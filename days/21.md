# Build a Personal Site (Notion) - Day21

Hello there!! 👋

Day 21, here we go! 

Today is the final day of our Notion learning sprint!

# Task for today 🚀

Today I'll be setting you something to **build** using Notion. Again, this Build phase is all about giving you the space to apply your learning.

📝 **Task type**: Building

🧱 **No-Code Learning Sprint**: Build, Share, Reflect

⏲️ **Estimated time**: 30 mins

🛠️ **Tools**: [Notion](https://www.notion.so/), [Popsy](https://popsy.co/) (optional), [Super](https://super.so/) (optional)

👇 **Challenge...**

1. Build a personal site using Notion. Checkout [this article](https://www.notion.so/customers/personal-websites) for some inspiration as well as [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THRRxDd3klw&t=445s) by Romy Misra to help you get going.

> If you'd like to publish your website to a custom domain, try out [Super.so](https://super.so/) or [Popsy](https://popsy.co/). 

> P.S I'm a big fan of this [personal website template here](https://www.samdickie.me/notion-personal-site-template)!

2. Once built, it's time to **Share** it with the world! Remember this is a key step in our no-code learning sprint. It's a way for you to get feedback, inspire others and mark this day with a digital reference point for you to look back on. Use the big red button below to help you get started.

3. To close this learning sprint, **Reflection** is key, especially as we'll be focusing on another tool tomorrow. Ask yourself, what you enjoyed about the tool, where you might use it in the future and what areas of it you would like to dive deeper into.

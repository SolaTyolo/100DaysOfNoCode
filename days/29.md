# Build a Location Based Diretory ( Softr ) - Day29


Hello there!! 👋

Day 29, here we go!

# Task for today 🚀

📝 **Task type**: Building

🧱 **No-Code Learning Sprint**: Follow

⏲️ **Estimated time**: 30 mins

🛠️ **Tools**: [Softr](https://www.softr.io/), [Airtable](https://www.airtable.com/)

👇 **Steps...**

1. Follow the tutorial below to build a location based directory. 

Softr recently released a Google Maps integration which you can read more about [here](https://docs.softr.io/integrations/google-maps-integration). This means that instead of statically showing location based information, we can now show it in a dynamic interactive way with a Google Map embed. 

So for example, if you had a list of restaurants on your site, instead of simply displaying the address as text, you will be able to show where it is exactly on a Google map. This will make it a far better user experience too! 

Follow along the step by step [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DstpMKS5wo) , to see how to do this in Softr. First, if you haven't already, curate a list of location based records in Airtable (i.e. best coffee shops in town). Now you're good to go!

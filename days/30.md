# Task for today 🚀

📝 **Task type**: Building

⏲️ **Estimated time**: 30 mins

🛠️ **Tools**: [Softr](https://www.softr.io/), [Airtable](https://www.airtable.com/)

👇**Challenge...**

1. Build your own marketplace

We use lots of marketplaces online today. You may book your next holiday on Airbnb or buy second hand goods with Ebay. The point is, marketplaces are popular platforms to build with no-code, and no doubt, one day I'm sure you'll have your own marketplace idea.

To help with this challenge, feel free to take a look at these [5 marketplace ideas](https://jungleworks.com/top-5-online-marketplace-ideas-for-2021-the-ultimate-guide/) to get some inspiration. 

And before you start building your own marketplace in Softr, check out [this template](https://colive.softr.app/) they have. This will give you a feel for the layout and features you may want to include. And read this story on [KidsCircle](https://www.softr.io/case-studies/kidscircle); a service marketplace providing online childcare, built on Softr. 

1. Once built, it's time to **Share** it with the world! Remember this is a key step in our no-code learning sprint. It's a way for you to get feedback, inspire others and mark this day with a digital reference point for you to look back on. 

2. To close this learning sprint, **Reflection** is key, especially as we'll be focusing on another tool tomorrow. Ask yourself, what you enjoyed about the tool, where you might use it in the future and what areas of it would you like to dive deeper into.

We'll follow the below steps in the video 👇

1. Sign up for a Twitter Developer account

2. Get your Twitter Developer API Keys

3. Add the Twitter Developer API Keys to the bubble twitter plugin fields. ( Add keys twice! 1 for live and 1 for development )

4. Apply for Twitter Developer Elevated Access.

Take your time in following these steps. Setting up your developer account can feel mundane however the steps shown in the video will speed up the process!

The main purpose of today is just to get the keys from Twitter that you need and add them to bubble. Twitter will ask what you are building, just simply describe that you are building a simple app for users to send tweets to twitter.

Completing this step means you get to progress to the next step which is the fun part!

# Seet Up Your Wiki Landing Page  - Day34


Hi Builder! 👋

[Colleen](https://twitter.com/colleenmbrady) again. Today, we’re going to start building. 😀

But first, a disclaimer: What we start building today is a page that we will be revisiting throughout this learning path. It’s not important to have something perfect by the end of today’s build. In fact, it’s not going to be possible as we will be creating content that will be on this page on subsequent days.

Let’s start building! 🛠️

#### Setting up a landing page for our wiki

Since our wiki is going to contain different sections, we’re going to start by drafting a landing page.

Here are the steps to follow....

1. Open [Notion](https://www.notion.so/)

2. [Create a new page](https://www.notion.so/help/create-your-first-page)

3. Give your page a name. Let’s use “Personal Wiki” for now.

4. Select an emoji for your page. You can use one of the built in options, use icons from a site like [notion.vip](https://www.notion.vip/icons/), or use your own 280px x 280px sized icons (depending on your plan).

5. Add a cover header. Like page emojis, cover headers are optional. Taking the time to pick meaningful and memorable images is one way to ensure that this “personal” wiki is truly personalized.

6. Start arranging your content. Take the categories list from Day 1 and start arranging in a way that makes sense to you. You could start by creating the headings “Personal,” “Work,” “Learning” and “Play” and add items underneath.

    Watch [this video](https://www.loom.com/share/5316ef387d41482f812d1dc6a62f2fc1) to see how to do these steps. 

    💡 **Tip**: Don’t worry about making it perfect right now. For now, start putting content on the page and experiment with the different content blocks and ways text can be formatted. It will morph and change as we build new sections over the next several days.

7. That’s it for today

# Sneak Peek 👀
Tomorrow we’ll be creating some databases to track nocode tools, tutorials, and projects that we want to build. Start thinking about tutorials or courses that you might want to track in Notion, along with inspiring quotes or images.

# Set Up Your Account - Day34

Hello there!! 👋

[Harold](https://twitter.com/hdkstr) here again, welcome back!

After yesterday’s preparations we’re now going to create our MailerLite account. Let’s go!

# Task for today 🚀
Today we’ll sign-up for an account, apply to get our account approved and verify and authenticate our custom sending domain.

Not the most fun part if you ask me, so let’s get it over asap 👇

📝 **Task type(s)**: Preparation

⏲️ **Estimated time**: 20 minutes

🛠️ **Tools**: Mailerlite + your own registrar

👇 **Steps...**

1. Visit [here](https://www.mailerlite.com/signup) to create your account

2. Now follow Mailerlite’s instructions to first **complete your profile** and then **request approval**([read more about these steps here](https://www.mailerlite.com/help/how-to-get-approved))

    Note: if you mention **100DaysOfNoCode member** in the approval questionnaire under ‘How did you find out about MailerLite’, the mailerlite team will fastrack account approval for you. 

3. Next, go to your account settings and navigate to [domains](https://app.mailerlite.com/configuration/domains) to **verify and authenticate your sending domain**. This will help to increase the deliverability of your newsletters. To achieve this you’ll have to make some adjustments in the DNS records of your domain. How this exactly works might differ per registrar, so if you can’t figure it out with [MailerLite’s instructions](https://www.mailerlite.com/help/how-to-verify-and-authenticate-your-domain), I’d recommend to contact your registrar for this.

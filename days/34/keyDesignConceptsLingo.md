# Key Design Concepts + Lingo - Day34

Hello again üëã

[Mark](https://twitter.com/markbowley) here.

Today we're going to get familiar with some of the key design concepts to understand, as well as important lingo.

# Task for today üöÄ

üëá **Steps...**

Below are the core design concepts that will help you make usable products. They can be quite hard to grasp, so I‚Äôve tried to simplify them into bullet points. Don‚Äôt worry if you don‚Äôt fully understand them straight away, they may sink in better with practice. Come back to them as reference while you build.

## Grids & alignment

+ Our brains can **understand things quicker** if there‚Äôs at least some alignment.
+ Page elements generally align and relate in some way ‚Äì left, right, centred, etc. Don‚Äôt rigidly stick to one alignment for **everything** on a page ‚Äì vary it a little to add interest.
+ Relate the edges and axis of elements to something else nearby. That way they appear to have a **structure**, not just float.
+ Use a simple column grid to guide regular spacing. However, **don't treat grids as strict **rules**.
+ With long-form text stick to left-alignment, and use centred only on short-form text.

## Visual hierarchy

+ **If everything is important, nothing is important**. How can users find what they‚Äôre looking for if everything has the same look or emphasis?
+ Hierarchy visually guides users to find or do things, **without needing instruction**.
+ The most important elements should be **larger, bolder or coloured** differently.
+ **Group related elements** ‚Äì same visual style, or located together with space around.
+ Have a minimum of **3 distinct levels** of typography ‚Äì headings, subheadings and body copy.
+  Ask yourself, **where will the user's eyes go** initially (the focal point)? Then, what will they go to next? Do this for the page as a whole, and for individual parts.
  
## Consistency & pattern

+ If everything is **different and unique**, users won't know where to look. How can they find what they're looking for if there's no pattern?
+ When you have more consistency, it‚Äôs **easier to spot something inconsistent** ‚Äì to pay attention to.
+ Use **familiar** design patterns from other apps, **consistent** stylings for your UI elements, and **regular** patterns of page layout.
+ Aim for a balance of roughly 80% consistency / 20% unique in every thing you design.

## Spacing

+ Sometimes called "whitespace", **empty space** is a very powerful design tool.
    + reduces clutter, increasing clarity and focus.
    + shows how individual things are grouped or related.
    + creates regularity in layout.
+ Our eyes need spaces in order to **understand boundaries and separation**, to navigate.
+ Important page elements will **get noticed** more if there's space around them.
+ Add spacing around groups of elements, so it's **clear they're related**.
+ Increase space around important points to **focus attention**.
+ Pay attention even to text line spacing. This should be 130-150% of the font size as a guide, to ensure it‚Äôs comfortable to read.

## Accesibility

+ Good usability doesn‚Äôt always mean good accessibility. Take extra steps where you can. **Every little you can do** helps someone (plus Google likes it when you do!).
+ Make sure your text has a **strong contrast** from the background.
+ **Don't rely on colour** to convey information. Use it to enhance only.
+ Users shouldn't have to hover to find anything important in your layout.
+ Links and buttons should have **text that describes** the destination or action (e.g not simply ‚ÄúClick here‚Äù).
+ Where possible, form fields should have **strong borders** and labels above/next to them, not inside.
+ There‚Äôs so much more you can do with accessibility, but you will need to balance with against the time involved and who your main users are.

## Mobile

+ Get into the habit of creating a **mobile-sized design mockup** as well as desktop-sized. Just designing for desktop screens means you're not considering mobile users.
+ Check your **font sizes** on mobile. Overly small text is one of the most common errors made on mobile.
+ Make sure buttons are big enough to click easily on mobile.
+ An image doesn‚Äôt introduce a subject well, so place page headings above the main image on mobile, not the other way around.

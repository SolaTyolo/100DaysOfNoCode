# Database Design - Day34

Hello there!! üëã

[Harold](https://twitter.com/hdkstr) here again. 

Welcome back - today we're going to be doing some prep before we start building in the coming days. 

# Task for today üöÄ

The ultimate goal of this path is to build a directory site: a page that lists information you've stored, for example with restaurants, hotels, books or no-code tools.

We will show this to our visitors who come to our site built with Softr. Before we can do that, we first have to create a database that stores all data we need for our project, which is what we'll be planning for today.

üìù **Task type**: Planning

üß± **No-Code Learning Sprint**: Research / prep

‚è≤Ô∏è **Estimated time**: 30 mins

üõ†Ô∏è **Tools**: [Whimsical](https://whimsical.com/)

üëá **Steps...**

1. Read [this article](https://blog.airtable.com/what-is-a-relational-database/) to get to grips with the basics of databases. 

But before you dive into Airtable to set this up right away, we'll first create a visual overview of the information we need. This will help you set up your Airtable database in a structured and efficient way, and prevents you from getting lost between all tables and fields. It serves as your blueprint.

Make sure to open up [this template](https://whimsical.com/entity-relationship-diagram-RBkRErQpeqx343tTnLktqo) in Whimisical before moving forward. 

2.  Preparation

  + Clear the tables and remove the connections between them
U+ se one seperate table for every subject you'd like to show on your site. Remove redundant tables, or add extra tables when needed.
+ Put the subjects (title) on the first row in the middle column of the table. For example:
  
    - **Tools** for a table with a list of No-code tools
       
    - **Products** for a seperate table with products built with those tools (Products)

+ Add an extra colum to all tables


3. Add attributes to tables

+ Now list all attributes you want to use to describe those subjects below the titles. For example: Tool Name, Tool Website, Tool Logo etc.
    - In doing so, always start with a unique identifier, for example Tool ID, Product ID or Creator ID. This is the primary key of a table (PK)
+ Do this for all tables you have
+ Only list attributes in a table that are related to that specific subject.


4. Connect tables

+ When you have more than one table, you can now connect them to eachother to show the relationships
+ Then also specify the type of relationship, like you've read in the article above (one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many). For example:
    - A tool can be used to build multiple products, and products can be built using multiple tools (Many-to-many)
    - When focusing on indie creator (solo), this creator can make several products, but each product only has one creator (one-to-many).
+ Finally add the subjects of the connected tables as foreign keys (FK) at the bottom of the other tables. Checkout the example below...

5. That's it for today. We already have a nice overview of the structure of our database now

# Sneak Peek üëÄ
Tomorrow we are going to add the third columns of the tables as we are prepare to implement in Airtable.

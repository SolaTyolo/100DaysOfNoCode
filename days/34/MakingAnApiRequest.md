# Making an API Request - Day34


Hello there!! 👋

[Marc](https://twitter.com/MrMarcFletcher) here again.

Let’s take yesterdays learning a step further with some actual moving of data using API requests. We’ll take a tour around [Hoppscotch.io](https://hoppscotch.io/cn) which is a neat tool for easily interacting with APIs and appreciating the form a Request and Response take. We’ll look over an API documentation file and get a feel for a few typical API ‘rules’. Finally we’ll take a look at an API document in [Airtable.com](https://www.airtable.com/) that will set us up nicely for tomorrow’s tasks.


# Task for today 🚀

📝 **Task type(s)**: Follow along video activity

⏲️ **Estimated time**: 30 mins

🛠️ **Tools**: [Hoppscotch](https://hoppscotch.io/cn) [Punk API](https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2) [Airtable](https://www.airtable.com/)

👇 **Steps...**

It’s good to understand what is happening behind the with your API requests so you can configure and debug your no-code projects. Today’s video dives deeper into APIs; instead of just retrieving (GET) data from an API, we’ll send (POST) some data to an API.

It, will be worthwhile reviewing the API glossary from yesterday as we’ll be covering all the item in the practical build. In addition to that, here’s a list of the types of API request that are typically made. You can see how they relate to the 4 basic methods of software data storage: Create, Read, Update & Delete (C.R.U.D).

**POST** - Create - Write data to a database

**GET** - Read - retrieve data from a database

**PATCH** - Update - revise data in a database

**DELETE** - Delete - remove data from a database.

After watching the video, your task is to make various requests to the Punk API and also use Hoppscotch to play about with other (no auth needed) APIs from [this directory](https://mixedanalytics.com/blog/list-actually-free-open-no-auth-needed-apis/). 

See if you can force an error on a request and study what happens in the Response window.


# Sneak Peek 👀
Tomorrow we’ll start to build a waitlist website that will send data to a database using the Airtable API. Part 1 will be setting up the database so make sure you sign up for an [Airtable](https://www.airtable.com/) base in advance.

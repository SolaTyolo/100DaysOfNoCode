# The Adventure Begins - Day32


Hello there!! üëã

Day 32 - your Phase 3 adventure begins!

Up until this point, you've been receiving daily emails from me. That's not going to change. But in Phase 3, you'll be able to pick and choose what you learn depending on your goals or outcomes. 

If you ever watched [Black Mirror's Bandersnatch episode](https://www.npr.org/2018/12/28/680671691/black-mirror-bandersnatch-makes-you-choose-your-own-adventure?t=1638351498199), it's like that.

**Wait, what's Phase 3 again?**

Good question. To recap, whilst **Phase 1** prescribed what you'll be learning each day and **Phase 2** went deeper into a specific tool stack, **Phase 3** leans on the fact that you will have your own interests and reasons for learning to no-code. You may want to build a side project or startup or just be able to take some of the manual tasks off you're plate.

Whatever they may be, we want to help you get there.

That's why we're creating modular learning paths for you to pick from as you learn. Think of each path as a block that you can choose to plug into your own personalised 100 day journey, pick n' mix style.

# Choose your next steps üöÄ


Today is about choosing what you want to learn next. Currently, we only have a handful of paths you can pick from, but we'll be adding to this list all the time. 

We've broken paths into two catagories. **Concepts** like database design, API's or design that you can apply to any no-code tool and **Usecases** like how to build a membership site that help you build for specific outcomes. 

**Choosing your path**

To help you choose which path to take next, we've created [this mini Notion page](https://narrow-ixora-7de.notion.site/100DaysOfNoCode-Paths-d670e0434f1e4816962d07df6bcdfbbd) which outlines more information on each live path, and what other paths are currently being worked on. You can toggle to see info on live tasks and the full curriculum being worked on by changing the view.

Once you've made your mind up, simply click on the below path in red that you want to do next (**only click on one**). This will trigger the first day of your new learning path a day from now.

# Task for today üöÄ

üìù **Task type**: Listen

‚è≤Ô∏è **Estimated time**: 25 mins

A 100DaysOfNoCode [podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtcOyKCsC0) has been in the works for a little while, but today we finally released our first sample episode. 

Each episode will focus on one remarkable creator and they went from idea to product (with no-code) to first (paying) users. We want to highlight how no-code is giving rise to profit generating, impact-making internet businesses and side projects. 

[Episode 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtcOyKCsC0) is hosted by [Tony](https://twitter.com/SideHustleBooks) + produced by [Aditya](https://twitter.com/PodcastStudio41), and delves into how 100DaysOfNoCode came to be. Sit back, relax and get inspired (hopefully!). Any feedback you have, send it my way.

**What is Softr?**

Softr is a no-code tool that lets you turn your Airtable data into full-stack web apps with out of the box memberships, payments and logic in one place.

**Key Softr concepts**

Softr's core concept is the **building block**. You have the freedom of arranging the blocks in any order, grouping them into pages and defining a particular set of links and relationships within your application.

These are like lego, and each block enables you to configure the design too.

Below is a picture of what the interface of Softr looks like. To add blocks, you would simply click the ➕ button and a list of the different blocks you can add will appear on the right hand side.

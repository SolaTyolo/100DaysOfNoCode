# Create a Newsletter - Day11

Hello there!! 👋

As you go through this challenge, I'm sure you're getting a few ideas along the way. I would love to hear more about them and help where I can, so feel free to reply to this email with what project(s) you want to build. 

Anyway, let's get into today's task!

# Task for today 🚀

 Today we'll be creating a newsletter. 

I'm sure you have that one interest you fall down many rabbit holes on. This may be a sign for you to start your own newsletter as an outlet for all the ideas, information and resources you're collecting. Who knows!

Anyway, in today's task we'll be setting up a mini landing page with a subscribe form that captures emails into your mail provider. 

📝 **Task type**: Mini (guided) challenge

🧱 **Project**: Create a newsletter

⏲️ **Estimated time**: 20-30 mins

🛠️ **Tools**: [Mailerlite](https://www.mailerlite.com/), [Softr](https://www.softr.io/)

👇 Steps...

1. First, create an account with Softr (you should already have one from our Day 6 task!)

2. Now, start an application from scratch. Once your new application has loaded, add a 'Hero' block. You want to pick the one with an email capture. 

3. It's time to connect your email capture with a mail provider to take in the emails that subscribe. That's where [Mailerlite](https://www.mailerlite.com/) comes in, so first create an account for it. It's what I use to send out these daily emails.

4. Come back to Softr, and click into your Hero block. Navigate to where it says 'Button'. Underneath this, you'll be able to configure the Text and Action. On Action is where you can click 'Add to Mailerlite'. 

5. It's asking us for an 'Action URL'. Let's go and find that. Follow the steps in [this guide](https://docs.softr.io/integrations/mailerlite). Before you do that, make sure to create a group in Mailerlite. You can do this by clicking Subscribers > Groups > Create Groups.




6. You should now be ready to simply add your 'Action URL' into Softr. Once connected, any email that subscribes will now be sent to your Mailerlite account. 

7. You may be wondering, "What's the point of sending them to Mailerlite"? Well, you'll now be able to not only store subscriber emails but of course, send them emails too. You can even set up an automation in Mailerlite that sends a welcome email as soon as a new subscriber joins a specific group you've created.


8. To set this up, read from where it says 'Trigger 1' in [this article](https://www.mailerlite.com/blog/what-are-automation-triggers-and-how-you-can-use-them). 

9. Now you should have everything set up to start your Newsletter (apart from actually writing the email itself 😅). To send a newsletter to your subscribers, you can create a campaign. Or if you want to send a daily automated sequence like 100DaysOfNoCode, you'll want to create an automation.

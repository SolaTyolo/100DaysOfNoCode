# Create a Form - Day5


Hello there!! 👋

Hope you had fun in mmm yesterday!

I wanted to share a quick quote from the book Atomic Habits, that resonated with me today...

**“Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement”**

Let's GO!

# Task for today 🚀


Today we'll be creating our own form and a couple of other things!

You may be thinking that forms don't sound that exciting or important, but they're actually a key ingredient to most no-code projects. That's because you'll often find that you need to capture data related to what you're working on. 

In my own case, when someone joins the 100DaysOfNoCode community, I use a form to collect information on their name, email, goals and more. I will then send this data into my CRM.

📝 **Task type**: Mini (guided) challenge

🧱 **Project**: Create your own form

⏲️ **Estimated time**: 20-30 mins

🛠️ **Tools**: [Tally](https://tally.so/), [Zapier](https://zapier.com/), [Airtable](https://www.airtable.com/)

👇 Steps...

1. Create an account with [Tally](https://tally.so/) 

2. Now think of a usecase you may have for capturing data via a form. This could be related to a project you have in mind. If you need some inspiration for what information to capture, flick through [these examples](https://showcase.tally.so/).

3. Once you have decided on what information you want to collect from your form, you can start configuring the steps. [Read this](https://blog.tally.so/create-your-first-form/) to help you along. 

4. If you're feeling ambitious, try to utilise one of Tally's advanced features in your form. For example, if there's a case where a question in your form will need to change depending on someone's anwer to a previous question, you can try implementing some conditional logic. [Read this](https://blog.tally.so/conditional-form-logic/) to familarise yourself. 

5. Once you're happy with how your form looks and functions, it's time for you to test it! Go through it as a user would to check it's working as you intended. 

6. Once you start capturing data into this form, Tally will save your responses. However, it's often more useful to keep your data in an actual database. That's why in this step, you should create a new Airtable base. Once you have done this, follow [these instructions](https://blog.tally.so/integrate-tally-with-airtable/) to integrate this base with Tally. Once integrated, all your form responses will automatically sync to your Airtable base. Volia!!

➕ **Bonus task**: Embed your Tally form into your Carrd website

If you remember from [Day 2's Task](https://mynocodejournal.com/#carrd), you created a digital journal using Airtable and Carrd. As a bonus task, you can embed your Tally form into this Carrd website. [Read this](https://blog.tally.so/embed-content-in-tally-forms/) to learn more.

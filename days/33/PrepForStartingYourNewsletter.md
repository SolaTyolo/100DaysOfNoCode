# Prep for Starting your Newsletter - Day33

Hello there 👋

[Harold](https://twitter.com/hdkstr) here, from The Netherlands 👋

After a long time of just [following from the sidelines](https://twitter.com/hdkstr/status/1456719016072986624) and lurking on No-code Twitter, I finally started to build myself in October 2021 when I joined the first bootcamp of 100 Days Of No Code. Since I really had a warm welcome in the world of No-code this way, I now would love to pay it forward to other beginners. Therefore, I’m starting a [newsletter](https://www.nocode.gifts/) about the gifts No-code provides, hoping to help others to get started too.

**Do you also want to set up a newsletter?**

In this learning pack I’ll share how you can set up your own with Mailerlite, to keep your followers posted (and your customers - hopefully at some point). Follow along 👇

**Why Mailerlite?**

There are a lot of tools around you can use for your newsletter. Here we’ll go for MailerLite as this is a complete and affordable tool. You probably already saw it a lot, as Max uses Mailerlite too for the 100 Days Of No Code challenge and his weekly digests.

Tomorrow we are going to create our accounts, but if you want to get to know more about MailerLite already you can take a peek at their rich [list of features](https://www.mailerlite.com/features) on their website.

# Task for today 🚀

Today we’ll start with a warming-up, to prepare for setting up our MailerLite account smoothly in the next days:

📝 **Task type(s)**: Warming-up

⏲️ **Estimated time**: 30 minutes

🛠️ **Tools**: your own registrar, Notion

👇 **Steps...**

1. When we are going to create a MailerLite account tomorrow, they’ll ask you a few questions to approve your account. Make sure to mention **100DaysOfNoCode member**  in the approval questionnaire under ‘How did you find out about MailerLite as this will speed up the approval process. Another thing you can do to get approved faster is by providing your website (e.g. example.com) and a corresponding domain email address (e.g. info@example.com). Although this is not strictly necessary, I would recommend to register these today if you don’t have them already, because we’re also going to use this to increase the deliverability of your campaigns later. Contact your registrar when you need help with this.

2. In addition to this, it’s a good start to think about the goals and why of your newsletter before we begin. [Alina Sere](https://twitter.com/alina_thinks), the founder of [Creator Habits](https://creatorhabits.club/) - and also a member of the 100 Days Of No Code community - created a nice Notion worksheet for this. To prepare for your newsletter journey, you can find this worksheet below:

3. That's it for today. Share your goals, to validate your idea with others and/or to build in public

# Sneak Peek 👀
Tomorrow we’re going to create our Mailerlite account and get it all verified and authenticated.

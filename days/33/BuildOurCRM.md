# Build Our CRM - Day33

Hello there!! 👋

Lachlan from [Building With Bubble](https://buildingwithbubble.com/) here.

When I first discovered Bubble in 2019, it completely change my ability to create products. For the first time in my life, I felt empowered as a non-technical founder.

After building countless applications, I started creating a series of video tutorials to help other passionate founders like myself.

In today’s learning path, we’ll start preparing everything we need to build our own custom CRM using Bubble. This will include registering a free Bubble account, and getting free access to my full video course.

# Task for today 🚀

📝 **Task type(s)**: Warming up

⏲️ **Estimated time**: 10 mins

🛠️ **Tools**: Bubble

👇 **Steps...**

1. Creating a free Bubble account

    In order to build our CRM in Bubble, we’ll first need to register a free account [here](https://bubble.io/). If you’re already an existing Bubble user, you can jump ahead to the next step.

2. Familiarising yourself with Bubble

    If you’re a first-time Bubble user, the platform can sometimes feel overwhelming. With the ability to create anything from a blank Canvas, the learning curve is often steeper than most no-code tools.

    If you’re just getting started, I’d recommend checking out the [Bubble Academy](https://bubble.io/academy). It’s a library of free resources that Bubble has created to streamline the initial learning phase. In particular, I’d highly recommend watching the [fundamentals video series](https://bubble.io/video-course/what-you-can-build-1600816375750x929341407406063600).

3. Get free access to my CRM course

    If you’re like me, I find video resources to be the most effective learning medium. I’ve recently created a dedicated course that explains the step-by-step instructions to building a CRM like Salesforce in Bubble.

    As a 100DaysOfNoCode parrticipant, you can access this for free. Just follow this [link](https://lachlankirkwood1.podia.com/how-to-build-a-salesforce-crm-clone-with-no-code-using-bubble-video-course?coupon=100DONC) to start streaming the content.

# Sneak Peek 👀
Tomorrow we’ll start to build out our own custom database that will power our Salesforce clone.

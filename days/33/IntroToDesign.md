# Intro to Design - Day33


Hello there!! üëã

Mark here, from [Tiny Design Lessons](https://tinydesignlessons.com/).

Today we're going to learn about why design is important, why you should be excited about it, and how it can help you as a no-code builder.


# Task for today üöÄ
üìù **Task type(s)**: Reading & thinking

‚è≤Ô∏è **Estimated time**: 5-10 mins

üõ†Ô∏è **Tools**: None

üëá **Steps...**

Below is a quick intro into the world of design. I‚Äôve kept it simple and brief, so you can get warmed up rather than overwhelmed.

### **Don‚Äôt just make; influence.**

You‚Äôre currently learning to make things online. **That‚Äôs an incredibly powerful skill.**

What‚Äôs even more powerful is if you also **learn to influence** how people use what you make.

That‚Äôs the superpower using design can give you.

### **So what is design?**
Where on earth do I start? It‚Äôs so HUGE and complex to explain easily, which is why not everybody understands or applies it.

However you don‚Äôt need to know or apply everything, especially at your stage in product development. What we‚Äôre focussing on here are fundamentals that can **lift the experience users will have of your product**. And we want to do that so they can understand it, access it, and can enjoy and get value from it.

To sum it up simply, **design is about helping people to feel, understand or do something.**

+ Visual design arranges colours, text and images.
+ UX design optimises all the interactions.


These create a more enjoyable, accessible or easier user experience.

### **What happens if I don‚Äôt bother with design?**

Without applying design, you just have **features and content** that you know are needed.

**Their value** entirely depends on how well they can be used, or understood.

**Design bridges this gap.**

Imagine building a house and the door is hidden around the back, because it was easier to build it there. Maybe the stairs don‚Äôt go anywhere, you just wanted or had to include some.

Technically your house still has those features as a product, but they‚Äôre not designed in a way that **helps the someone use it, or maximises the overall value.**

### **Applying design from the beginning**

Here are two examples of design thinking used by famous companies, way back at their early growth stage.

‚ö°Ô∏è **Airbnb**

In the beginning Airbnb was making just $200 a week, until they **put themselves in the shoes of their customers.**

They realised their listings‚Äô photos were so poor quality, even they weren‚Äôt inspired. So they manually helped listers upgrade them all. After that, the company‚Äôs income doubled.

‚ö°Ô∏è **Amazon**

Amazon‚Äôs massive supply chains and distribution give it a clear advantage today. But in the beginning these simply didn‚Äôt exist ‚Äì they would take years to build.

So did they grow without that advantage? They started out with a lot of manual processes, and crucially ‚Äì a heavy focus on **improving the quality of the user experience**. That bridged the gap, helping them grow and build other advantages.

### **How does design help with no-code?**

With no-code, it‚Äôs easier than ever to build something. However, it‚Äôs harder than ever to **make an impact** with it.

No-code makers tend to focus on **how to build** something.

If you can also focus on **how it will be used**, you will make more impact.

### **How can I think more like a designer?**

Design is fundamentally about asking questions first, then making decisions. To make more impact using design, don‚Äôt treat it as an afterthought to your build.

Instead, **ask questions like these as you build**:

+ Can other people easily use this?
+ Am I communicating its value here?
+ How will users feel after they using this?


Without applying at least a bit of design thinking, it will be hard to achieve these if you have your head down building towards your perception of the finish line.

So even though no-code is allowing us to launch that much faster, taking a design approach requires some **slowing down and thinking about your potential users**.

### **Why does an MVP need design?**

Even though you‚Äôre building something minimal, it still needs some fundamentals to stand a good chance of success. In other words, it needs **some design** to be valuable.

Why? These days users expect any online experience to look and work to a basic level. They expect a it to be **usable and clear**, even if they know there‚Äôs more polish to come.

Of course you can always get away with less design, but that puts more pressure on **the value of your functions** and content.

### **Some MVP examples**

Although the design of these famous MVPs wasn‚Äôt very polished, the core design elements we associate with them today were already there. See Google below as an example.

Hello! 👋

My name is [Colleen](https://twitter.com/colleenmbrady). I’ll be your guide for the next phase of your #100DaysofNoCode journey.

On this expedition, we’ll be building a personal wiki for capturing ideas, organizing tasks, and sharing your work publicly. A well built wiki can help you focus by capturing the ideas in your head and save you money by reducing the number of apps you may currently use.

We’ll be using Notion because....

- It’s free to start
- It works on desktop, tablet, or phone
- It can handle free form and messy data and images and embeds and structured data
- Can be used to sell a product
- Can be used as the base for a website
- Has an API
- Can be kept private or shared with others


NOTE: Notion does not currently have an offline mode. If you anticipate needing access at times when internet access is not available, a different tool may be a better fit for you.

Let’s begin. 🚀

# Task for today 🚀
📝 **Task type(s)**: Planning, Researching, Reflecting

⏲️ **Estimated time**: 30 minutes

🛠️ **Tools**: Notion

🕹️ **Pre-requisites**:

+ A [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) account
+ Basic understanding of Notion. If you are just starting, watch the “[New to Notion](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzaYMdbJMZW0gYyfNhL0sHheU5WR2YKE1)?” YouTube series and [skim the documentation](https://www.notion.so/help) to understand what’s possible. [Learning keyboard shortcuts](https://www.notion.so/help/keyboard-shortcuts) can also speed up your workflow. [Scrolling through the template gallery](https://www.notion.so/templates) can give you an idea of what’s possible.
Additional Nice-to-Haves:

+ Access to Notion across different devices. Install the [desktop app](https://www.notion.so/desktop), [mobile app](https://www.notion.so/mobile), and [web clipper](https://www.notion.so/web-clipper).


👇 **Steps**...

Today, we’re going to start with several self-reflection activities. There are no wrong answers here. Notion is also very flexible, so don’t worry about having everything out of the gate.

Answer these questions on paper or by copying into a Notion page.

💡 For this exercise, consider using pen and paper. Going analog can help us see connections that we might not see or make when staring at a computer screen. Try creating a mind map. Use different colored pens. Doodle in the margins.

1. What do you want to track and manage at a high level?

    Here are some ideas.....

+ Personal Mission / Vision Statement, Goals and Milestones, Tasks and To Dos, Side Projects
+ Family Activities and Information (Activity Schedules,  School Calendar, Teachers’ List, Birthdays, Information for Pet Sitters, Grocery Shopping and Meal Planning, Home Maintenance). 
+ Bucket Lists and Favorites (Books, Movies, Music, Places to Visit, Recipes, TV Shows, Video Games)
+ How to learn NoCode
+ Health & fitness
+ Travel planning
+ Inspiration / Moodboards / Favorite Quotes
  
💡 Look around your desk. What sticky notes and other reminders are around you? Could those items be in a personal wiki?

2. What details do you want to track and manage? Go back to the list you just made. Do you need to capture due dates? URLs? We’ll use this information once we start building in Notion.

3. Are you someone who likes visuals?

   You’ll have the option to add icons and header images in Notion. Look through the list of what you want to track and start identifying visuals that you could use on your Notion pages.

+ Cover photos: Notion’s integration with Unsplash makes it easy to add header photos. You can also create your own using [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) or another graphics tool — just make sure that they are [sized at least 1,500px wide](https://www.notion.so/help/customize-and-style-your-content). For now, bookmark images for use later in the series.
+ Icons: Notion includes built-in icon options, which can quickly be added across platforms. But, they are generic and may not be meaningful to you. That’s where personalized icons can come to play. [Notion VIP icons](https://www.notion.vip/icons/) offers free icons, but you can also create your own, depending on your plan. If you make your own, be sure they are 280px x 280px.

💡 If you create header images or icons, [take time to host them somewhere on the web](https://www.notion.so/help/customize-and-style-your-content) so that you can add them to pages via a URL instead of a direct upload. That way, the icons will be available to you, no matter what device you are on. As an added bonus, you can change the graphic and easily update all instances in Notion at once.

4. Will you be sharing parts of your wiki with others? While we’re creating a personal wiki, there may be sections you’d like to share with others. Add an asterisk or plus to highlight content that may be shared and [learn how to share Notion content with others](https://www.notion.so/help/sharing-and-permissions).

5. That’s it for today

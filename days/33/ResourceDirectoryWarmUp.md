#  Resource Directory Warm Up - Day33

Hello there!! 👋

Harold here, from The Netherlands 👋

# Task for today 🚀

📝 **Task type**: Warming up

🧱 **No-Code Learning Sprint**: Research

⏲️ **Estimated time**: 20 mins

🛠️ **Tools**: [Airtable](https://www.airtable.com/), [Softr](https://studio.softr.io/auth/signup), [Whimsical](https://whimsical.com/signup)

👇 **Steps...**

1. To follow along with this pack, you'll need to make sure you have created an account with [Airtable](https://www.airtable.com/#), [Softr](https://www.softr.io/) and [Whimsical](https://whimsical.com/) on their free plans.

2. Once you have created these accounts, we'll start tomorrow with a first draft of the database scheme, using Whimsical's Flowchart features. To prepare, first make a list of information you want to show on your directory site. This could be a list of your favouriate sports players or coffee shops for example. 

3. Watch the [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARbjNYc_lKA) to get to grips with Whimsical.  

4. Create a new Whimsical project with [this template](https://whimsical.com/entity-relationship-diagram-RBkRErQpeqx343tTnLktqo)

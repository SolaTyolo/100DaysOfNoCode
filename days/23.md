üí° Once the account has been connected the first time, it will available to you in all subsequent Zaps and can be managed in the Apps section of the Zapier dashboard

+ Once the form is submitted, return to the Zap and Test Trigger on the action
The Data you submitted in the form should be visible in the information returned from the test.

**Step 4 - Create the Action**

If you have Slack you can use the Slack action. If not, you can use the built-in Zapier email app.

+ Search for email and choose **Email by Zapier**
+ Choose **Action Send Outbound Email**
  
üí° You can, at this stage use Google or Outlook email and is recommended if you are sending a lot of emails as there are restrictions on Zapier emails that allow only 10 per hour. Perfect for short internal and infrequent emails.

+ Populate the required information, recipient, Subject and Body.
  
üí° In the subject and body, make use of the information you have in Step one to make the email unique and meaningful. See below üëá

# Build a  Mobile App - Day8

Hello there!! 👋

Day 8 - HERE WE GO! 

Hope you're feeling rested and ready to start building again after yesterday's day of reflection 😊

# Task for today 🚀


Today we'll be creating a mobile app. 

People are often surprised when I tell them that you can create mobile apps with no-code. They're even more surprised when they find out how easy it is to build a simple one too. 

That's what we'll be creating today. Something like [this](https://www.glideapps.com/templates/employee-directory-yg). Very similar to the resource directory we built on day 6, but instead of a desktop view, it's a mobile app!

📝 Task type: Mini (guided) challenge

🧱 Project: Create a mobile app

⏲️ Estimated time: 25 - 30 mins

🛠️ Tools: [Glide](https://www.glideapps.com/), [Google Sheets](https://www.google.co.uk/sheets/about/)

👇 Steps...

1. If you still have the Google sheet you used from Day 6 with a list of 'things' (e.g. top holiday destinations etc..), you'll be able to use it for today too! Open your Google sheet or create a new one, and also make sure to create an account with [Glide](https://www.glideapps.com/). 

2. Once you have both of these open, create your Glide app by following [this step by step](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQYxJvE-0MA) video tutorial. In this tutorial, the creator is building a directory of a specific type of rock with four fields of data representing each rock which include name, description, image and URL. You can re-use any existing data you have and build your own list for a completely different topic - just make sure to use the same data fields he is capturing for each record.

3. After following the steps in the tutorial, it's ready to publish your mobile app. You can do this by simply hitting 'Publish' in the top right hand corner of Glide's interface. You'll be given a page link [like this one](https://close-development-7986.glideapp.io/) which you can share with others. 

➕ **Bonus task**

If you own an iPhone, iPad or Mac, you can take this task! To flip things from the above, using [Universe](https://onuniverse.com/) you can build your very own website all from your mobile phone 🤯 Imagine, you could be building a website on your commute or whilst your watching TV, just with a mobile phone...crazy!

Follow [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9Y3K2e80Ro&list=PL-wzQDsGKtjDtLa-7JCTKYG4qidIJE8XA&index=5) to build an online store. Or just feel free to have a play with the tool.

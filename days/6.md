# Build a Resource Directory - Day6


Hello there!! 👋

Congrats on making it to your 6th day of learning already - let's keep this up! 

#  Task for today 🚀


Today we'll be creating a directory!

You may have a list of things in a **spreadsheet** somewhere. For example, you may have created a list of the best coffee places in town. With no-code you can turn this list into a visual website and help others get benefit from it too! 

On our most recent 30 day MVP bootcamp, Ten built her very own directory of [Vietnamese restaurants](https://www.planetpho.co.uk/). You'll be creatinng something similar today. 


📝 Task type: Mini (guided) challenge

🧱 Project: Create a directory of resources

⏲️ Estimated time: 30 mins

🛠️ Tools: [Softr](https://www.softr.io/), [Airtable](https://www.airtable.com/)

👇 Steps...

1. To get yourself familiar with how Softr works, first read this guide [here](https://docs.softr.io/). This will get you familiar with the basic terminology used, the interface and how it works at a high level.

2. Now sign-in to Airtable and create a new Base. As mentioned before you may already have a list of resources to add in here. If this is in a Google sheet, you can simply press the ➕  button in Airtable to create a new table and this will give you the option to 'Quick Import from Google Sheets'. If you don't have existing data in a Google Sheets, make sure to add 10 records worth of data into your new Airtable table. For example, this could be your 10 favouriate cars or Youtube channels. 

💡 **Tip**: Before you gather this list, think about the data you want to include for each record. For example, if you're creating a list of the best coffee shops in town, you'll want to have the name, location, shopfront image and some other information about each one. This will help inform what field types you need to add into Airtable i.e you'll have the 'attachments' field type if you want to add images for each coffee shop. 

3. Come back to Softr, and create a new application by starting from scratch. Feel free to begin adding different blocks like headers, hero and more to your blank page. Most importantly, you need to add a List Block which you can find out more about [here](https://docs.softr.io/building-blocks/listings). 

4. Once you've added your List block, make sure to connect your Airtable account with Softr. By clicking on the list block, Softr will walk you through the steps to integrate both tools together.

5. Now start configuring your block to start seeing your Airtable data show up in your list block. To do this you'll need to toggle on List Item fields and map these to the corresponding fields you have in Airtable. For example, you can toggle on the 'text' type in Softr and map this to your 'name' field in Airtable. [Read this](https://docs.softr.io/building-blocks/listings) for more detail. 

6. Once you have the correct data coming through to your List Block in Softr, you can start playing with the look and feel of it by clicking on the 🎨  icons. 

7. Once you're happy with the page you've created, it's time to publish your site. [Read this](https://docs.softr.io/publishing-applications/publish) to see how. 


➕  **Bonus exercise** -  If your list of records includes location based information, you can turn this into an interactive Google map with Softr. [Watch this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DstpMKS5wo&t=60s) to see how.

# Build an Automation - Day3


Hello there!! 👋

Lovely to see you again - I'm glad we're starting to get into the groove now.

# Task for today 🚀

Today we'll be creating our first automation!

Without even knowing, you could probably automate A LOT of your weekly manual tasks and take them off your plate. There are a whole host of no-code tools that can do this for you.

That's why we'll be creating an automation!


📝 Task type: Mini (guided) challenge

🧱 Project: Create your 1st Automation

⏲️ Estimated time: 25 - 30 mins

🛠️ Tools: [Zapier](https://zapier.com/)

👇 Steps...

1. To get yourself familiar with how Zapier works, first watch this mini video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S1yzf9FDnk) and then read this article [here](https://zapier.com/help/create/basics/create-zaps). This will get you familiar with the basic terminology used, the interface and how it works at a high level.

2. Now write down the manual tasks that you do on a daily or weekly basis. This could be as simple as sending the same weekly email, updating a spreadsheet everyday or something else. Check out [this](https://zapier.com/blog/what-you-should-automate/) article for inspiration. And if you're still not sure what kind of tasks can be automated, they usually have the following 3 traits...   
> -  **Tasks you have to do frequently**. Example: Sending a weekly reminder to your team to fill out a meeting agenda.
> -   **Anything where you have to move information from one app to another**. Example: Adding tasks from a project management app into your personal to-do list app.
> - **Tasks that don't require much thinking**. Example: Copying the emails of event attendees to a spreadsheet.
  

3. Now it's time to select one or two of those manual tasks to automate. As this is your first automation, try and pick something that doesn't have too many steps or apps involved.

4. Once you've picked which manuel task(s) to automate, it's time to deconstruct it. This will help you design the automation. First, map out the current steps involved in this manual process and then list out the tools you use in it. What can be helpful here, is to visualise this process into a flowchart using a tool like [Whimsical](https://whimsical.com/). And [this cheatsheet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gIErIXDVk7xIkzpwGjrLHkKRl_lFpGvz/view) will help you think through this step. 

5. It's time to set up your automation in Zapier. Feel free to re-read or watch the above video and article I linked. If you need some extra guidance, it can be helpful to find Zaps (automations) that are similar to the one you want to create. [Here](https://zapier.com/learn/automate-apps-examples/popular-app-automations/) is a good list. You can use these as templates and analyse how they have been designed, to learn best practice and reverse engineer how pre-existing workflows were made!

6. Turn on your Zap and start saving precious time!!

# Celebrate Your 1st Week - Day7

Hello there!! 👋

You've made it through your 1st whole week of no-code - that's HUGE! 


# Task for today 🚀

Whilst very exciting, learning any new skill can be a little overwhelming and exhausting! 

That's why today it's important for us to put down our digital tools and reflect + process what we've learnt this week. 

Just to recap, this week you've built...

+ A digital journal ➡️  to track progress
+ An automation ➡️  to boost efficiency
+ A personal website ➡️  to build an online presence
+ A form ➡️  to capture data 
+ A resource directory ➡️  to share curated information
  
All without writing a single line of code!

And for these projects, you've used a total of 7 no-code tools including [Carrd](https://carrd.co/), [Airtable](https://www.airtable.com/), [Zapier](https://zapier.com/), [Tally](https://tally.so/), [mmm](https://mmm.page/), [Softr](https://www.softr.io/) and [Google Sheets](https://www.google.co.uk/sheets/about/)! That's pretty impressive! 

📝 Task type: Writing

🧱 Project: Reflect on your 1st week

⏲️ Estimated time: 15-20 mins

🛠️ Tools: N/A

👇 Steps...

**1.** Find somewhere quiet and write down your thoughts on the below three questions...

+ What were your key takeaways from this 1st week?
+ What did you enjoy most from this 1st week?
+ What do you want to dive deeper into or learn more about in the coming days and weeks? 
  
Answering these questions will help you process what you've learnt and pinpoint tools or topics that are most interesting to you. When we hit Phase 3 of this program, it'll be far easier for you to pick which learning paths to dive into. 

**2.** To make sure your friends keep holding you accountable and as a way to leave a digital reference that you can look back on, share your answers with others!

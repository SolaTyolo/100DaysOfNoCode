📝 Task type: Building

🧱 No-Code Learning Sprint: Build

⏲️ Estimated time: 30 mins

🛠️ Tools: Glide

👇 Challenge...

1. Build your own mobile app in Glide. 

This in itself could be a little dauting, especially if you don't have an idea for a mobile app. 

That's why I recommend you go to [Glide's app template marketplace](https://www.glideapps.com/templates), for some inspiration. If there's a template you want to replicate in a similar way, you can add it into your account and peel it back to see how it was built. This will give you some guidance. 

Plus, lets not forget, you've built up some key skills in Glide over the past two days of this sprint, so it's time to put them to the test! 

2. Once built, it's time to **Share** it with the world! Remember this is a key step in our no-code learning sprint. It's a way for you to get feedback, inspire others and mark this day with a digital reference point for you to look back on. 

3. To close this learning sprint, **Reflection** is key, especially as we'll be focusing on another tool tomorrow. Ask yourself, what you enjoyed about the tool, where you might use it in the future and what areas of it would you like to dive deeper into.

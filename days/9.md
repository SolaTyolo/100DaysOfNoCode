# Build a Voice App - Day9

Hello there!! üëã

I thought I'd share this quote...

"No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of your new identity" - James Clear

A.K.A You won't become a no-code wizard over night, but day by day as you take these bitesized challenges, your new identity will slowly reveal itself. Keep going!!

# Task for today üöÄ

Today we'll be creating a voice app. 

"Wait what's a voice app"? 

It something you can control with spoken commands. Think of the Google Assistant on your phone or Amazon Alexa. 

Yep...you can build that with no-code. Just for extra context, [here](https://twitter.com/HainingMax/status/1425819384132423692?s=20) are a few examples of voice apps (built without any code). 

üìù Task type: Mini (guided) challenge

üß± Project: Create a voice app

‚è≤Ô∏è Estimated time: 30-40 mins

üõ†Ô∏è Tools: [Voiceflow](https://www.voiceflow.com/)

üëá Steps...

1. Voice can be a little tricky to wrap your head around at first, so [watch this video](https://www.voiceflow.com/tutorials/introduction-to-voiceflow) to get yourself familiar with Voiceflow and the different building blocks you have at your disposal. 

2. Create a [Voiceflow](https://www.voiceflow.com/) account. 

3. Now we're ready to do some building. On Day 6, we connected our list of things to a web frontend. On Day 8, we connected our list of things to a mobile frontend. Today, we'll be connecting our list of things (in Airtable) to Voice as the frontend (or the interface). But first open up an Airtable base you've already used this week or create a fresh one. 

4. Follow the steps in the  [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFE8wAFfTx4&list=PLKYemGIohRgC32kIifxlbUX8MYkl1wjt8&index=14) to connect your Airtable base with Voiceflow. Making this connection will allow you to set voice commands. For example, if you had a list of tasks in your Airtable base, you can set a voice command like "what's my next task" as the trigger for your voice application to respond with the correct answer. By the end of this tutorial, you should have built your first voice application!


5. You can create a testable version of your project in the browser on web or mobile by clicking on 'Share' ‚è© 'Share Prototype' in Voiceflow. Once done, hit the red button below.

If you'd like to learn more about voice itself and the various usecases it has, feel free to watch [this workshop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRw_ek5X3nI&t=1514s) we had for members of the 100DaysOfNoCode community.

Also, as part of today's lesson, we made our first API call. Whilst technically we have already done this with other tasks, the process of doing this was more hidden from view. Whereas today, the process was more visible. Although this is a more advanced topic, feel free to explore API's further by watching [this workshop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWYKpSq02HU&t=196s) as an introduction.

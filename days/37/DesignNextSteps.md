# Design Next Steps - Day37


Hello there!! 👋

[Mark](https://twitter.com/HainingMax) here again.

Now that you’ve practiced design fundamentals in the previous steps, I hope it's given you a taste for what's possible. Please don’t stop here! Here, I’m going to give you some ways you can **keep learning and practicing design** – use the links and information below as a reference library.


# Task for today 🚀
📝 **Task type(s)**: Reading & research

⏲️ **Estimated time**: However long you want!

🛠️ **Tools**: None

👇 **Steps...**


The steps we’ve gone through just scratch the surface of design and usability. Here are some useful links, based on the key principles we've covered. So feel free to take a read at your leasure and take your design skills to another level!

#### Useful reading

Take a look at [this Notion doc](https://narrow-ixora-7de.notion.site/Design-resources-5a4692460ad14051892d8819cecd70e5), with all the extra resources on it! 

#### User Research

If you're serious about good usability, you should really do research as well as actual designing. There wasn't time to cover this in the guide, but it can be done simply. **Just put your work in front of real potential users**, early and often:

- Set up 1-1 Zoom calls to interview potential users
- Watch them use your prototype to complete a goal
- Observe where it confuses or annoys them, etc.
- Ask further questions about the experience
  
When you've collated all that feedback, don't just action every comment or note. **Look for patterns across it all** and judge what you can change, based on time and resources available.

That's all from me!! It's been an absolute pleasure taking you through this learning path, and I hope you enjoyed it.

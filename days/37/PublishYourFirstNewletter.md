# Publish Your 1st Newsletter - Day37


Hello there!! 👋

It’s time to create your first newsletter. Are you ready?


# Task for today 🚀
Today we’re going to create the first issue of your newsletter, to share your story, ideas or whatever you want to send to your subscribers. Let’s go 💪

📝 **Task type(s)**: Building

⏲️ **Estimated time**: 30 minutes

🛠️ **Tools**: Mailerlite

👇 **Steps...**

1. Login to MailerLite and navigate to Campaigns

2. Create a new campaign with the nice orange button...

3. We’re going to send a regular campaign. 1) give your campaign a name, 2) add a subject for the newsletter, 3) adjust the sender if you’d like, 4) check the language and 5) and check the tracking options. Then click the orange button to proceed.

**Note**: Click on insert personalization - near the subject field - to customize the subject if you’d like. For example to add their name. You can also use these variables in the content of your email. Read here [how to use variables in MailerLite](https://www.mailerlite.com/help/how-to-use-variables-in-mailerlite).

4. Next, you can choose how you want to create the content of your newsletter: 1) with one of the editors, 2) from a template, or 3) based on a recent email. We’re going to reuse our welcome email for this, which we designed yesterday:

Go to recent emails and select automations from the dropdown menu in the top left corner (see screenshot). Now your welcome mail will appear and you can select this one for your newsletter.

5. Now you can edit your newsletter with Mailerlite’s drag & drop editor, just like we did yesterday with the welcome email ([you can find their instructions here](https://www.mailerlite.com/help/how-to-use-the-drag-and-drop-editor)).

6. Click on preview and test in the black header if you want to look at a preview or send yourself a test mail (recommended!), and click on the green button (Done editing) when you’re finished

7. Next, you can select the recipients you want to send your newsletter to. Select the boxes for the groups you want to include - or navigate to Advanced for more advanced rules.

8. Now review everything carefully in the next step - send yourself a test email if you didn’t do that already - and make sure you’re ready to go.

9. Finally you can schedule when your newsletter needs to be sent: 1) immediately, 2) later or 3) at a specific time in all different time zones. When all is set you can push the SEND-button to get the word out 🚀 Congrats!

**Note**: Curious how your newsletter performs? Once the email is sent you can follow the results in its [campaign report](https://www.mailerlite.com/help/how-to-analyze-and-export-reports). And to learn more it’s also very insightful to connect with your subscribers in another way, and ask them how they like your newsletter.

10. Don’t forget to celebrate and share your newsletter on [social media](https://www.mailerlite.com/help/how-to-share-your-newsletter-beyond-email) if you want.

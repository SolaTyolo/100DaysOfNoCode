# Building the Frontend - Day37


Hello there!! 👋

[Harold](https://twitter.com/hdkstr) here again. 

Yesterday we've made an overview of all the pages and blocks we'll need to build. We can use this as a checklist as we're building. 

# Task for today 🚀
📝 **Task type**: Building

🧱 **No-Code Learning Sprint**: Building

⏲️ **Estimated time**: 30 mins

🛠️ **Tools**: [Whimsical](https://whimsical.com/signup), [Softr](https://www.softr.io/)

👇 **Steps...**

### 1. Create your pages

- Create a new application in Softr and start from scratch
- If you're not familiar with this yet, [read this](https://docs.softr.io/studio/pages#how-to-create-duplicate-and-delete-pages) to learn how to create pages with Softr.
- Now add all pages from your sitemap into Softr. If you have multiple pages that are very similar, instead of creating them all seperately, you could also choose to finish only one and duplicate that page afterwards (including the blocks, design and settings). This might save you some time. But if you do this, make sure to change the names of these duplicated pages accordingly, and connect every page to the right table in Airtable tomorrow.


Below you can find an overview of all my pages, according to sitemap I've shared yesterday...

### 2. Add your blocks

- When you've created all your pages, you can now add all your [building blocks](https://docs.softr.io/building-blocks) to the pages. Click on the yellow circle in the right top corner (+) and add all blocks listed from your sitemap. 


### 3. Add your own content and design customisation

You can now start adding into content and customising the design of your pages and blocks. To learn more about design in Softr, I'd recommend watching [Design Workshop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c35kUVxZR24&feature=youtu.be). 

### 4. Share your progress

We're now ready to connect Airtable and Softr tomorrow. 

# Sneak Peek 👀
Tomorrow we'll connect all list blocks to Airtable to present our records, and then finally we will set up the list detail blocks for more information about each record.

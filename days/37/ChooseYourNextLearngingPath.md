# Choose your Next Learnging Path - Day37


Hello there!! ðŸ‘‹

Looks like it's time for you to select another learning path to continue your 100DaysOfNoCode journey. 


# Choose your next steps ðŸš€
Today is about choosing what you want to learn next. Currently, we only have a handful of paths you can pick from, but we'll be adding to this list all the time.

We've broken paths into two catagories. **Concepts** like database design, API's or design that you can apply to any no-code tool and **Usecases** like how to build a membership site that help you build for specific outcomes.

### Choosing your path

To help you choose which path to take next, we've created [this mini Notion page](https://narrow-ixora-7de.notion.site/100DaysOfNoCode-Paths-d670e0434f1e4816962d07df6bcdfbbd) which outlines more information on each live path, and what other paths are currently being worked on. You can toggle to see info on live tasks and the full curriculum being worked on by changing the view.

Once you've made your mind up, simply click on the below path in red that you want to do next (**only click on one learning path**) - that's all you have to do, nothing else. This will trigger the first day of your new learning path a day (24 hours) from now.

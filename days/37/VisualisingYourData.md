# Visualising your Data - Day37


Hello there!! üëã

[Lachlan](https://twitter.com/LachlanKirkwood) here again.

Today‚Äôs the final installment of my learning path to help build your CRM using Bubble.

In my last email, we‚Äôd taken the time to build out the core functionality of our CRM. Today, however, we‚Äôll be creating a way to visualise data about customers stored in our database.

Let‚Äôs get right into it!

# Task for today üöÄ
üìù **Task type(s)**: Building

‚è≤Ô∏è **Estimated time**: 30 mins

üõ†Ô∏è **Tools**: Bubble

üëá **Steps...**

1. **Preparation**

Before we get started, I‚Äôd recommend opening the free video course I‚Äôd given you access to in my first email. Take the time to watch lesson 8 within the series. This lesson will highlight everything you need to know about visualising data in Bubble.

2. **Installing the chart plugin**

If we‚Äôre visualising data, we‚Äôll of course need to display a series of charts in Bubble. In order to do this, we‚Äôll need to first install the free Chart Element plugin from the plugin library.

3. **Configuring your chart data source**

In our example today, I‚Äôd like to create a pie chart that displays a breakdown of all the customers in our database by their lead status. This will help us identify what portion of our customers are leads, what portion are converted customers, and what portion are expired contacts.

We‚Äôll start by adding a chart element onto our page, then selecting the style of this chart to be a pie chart.

After adding the element onto our page, we‚Äôll then configure our data source. In this instance, the type of data we‚Äôll want to display is a ‚Äòcustomer‚Äô.

Under our data source, we‚Äôll then need to perform a search for all of the customers saved within our database. From here, we‚Äôll then need to group these customers into segments represented by their ‚Äòcustomer status‚Äô data field.

Once we‚Äôve configured our data source, we can focus on labeling the expressions used to display this data.

For our value expression, we‚Äôll select the ‚Äòcurrent point‚Äôs count‚Äô option. This will allow our chart to display a count of how many customers fit into each segment within our chart.

Finally, under our label expression, we‚Äôll display the ‚Äòcurrent point‚Äôs customer status‚Äô. This will display each of our customer status segments (lead, customer, expired).

4. **Preview the chart**

Now, it‚Äôs time to preview what your chart looks like. Hit the preview button in the top right-hand corner and watch your chart come to life.

5. **That's it for today**. 



# Sneak Peek üëÄ
And that‚Äôs a wrap for my learning path. If you‚Äôd like to display any additional data within your CRM, I‚Äôd always recommend playing around with different charts and data sources.

In the meantime, I wish you all the best in your own no-code journey!

Tomorrow you'll be picking your next learning path.

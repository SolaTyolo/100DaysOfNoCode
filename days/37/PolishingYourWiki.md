# Polishing your Wiki


It’s [Colleen](https://twitter.com/colleenmbrady). 👋

🎊 Congratulations on making it this far in your #NoCode Journey! You now have a strong foundation for your personal wiki.

Today, we’re going to go back to where we started. Find the notes you initially made and return to the “Personal Wiki” page you created.

Let’s continue building! 🛠️

# Task for today 🚀
📝 **Task type(s)**: Building, Reflecting

⏲️ **Estimated time**: 40 minutes

🛠️ **Tools**: Notion

👇 **Steps...**

1. Review your initial notes.

2. Review what you’ve built.

3. Re-arrange and update the content on your “Personal Wiki” page. Does the name make sense? Should it be “Dashboard”? Should it be something humorous or serious to better match your personality? Add what’s missing and remove what isn’t necessary. This is your space.

4. Incorporate linked databases on your wiki. Add in NoCode tutorials you want to watch or the tasks for your current build. Make the changes so that this wiki works for you.

5. Make a plan for what you want to do next. We only covered a few modules in this series. Return to your initial list. Is it time to start working on a database of favorite songs to listen to while building? Decide what changes are to be made next and schedule time.

6. Update page permissions. If you decided to make select pages public, double check that permissions are set properly.

7. Check your design on mobile. Multiple columns may look good on desktop, but does it still work for you on mobile?

💡 Now that you have a personal wiki started, how can you take what you’ve learned here and turn it into something others can duplicate or something you can sell?

That’s it for today

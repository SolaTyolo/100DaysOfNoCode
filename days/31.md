# Welcom to Phase 3! - Day31


Hello there!! ðŸ‘‹

Day 31 - you made it to **Phase 3...** welcome!

It's no mean feat to learn a skill for 30 days straight but here you are, so hats off.

One interesting part of learning to no-code is the transiton you make (if you're coming from a non-techie background) from being an **ideas person to a builder**. It can be hard to shed you're previous identity but don't lose faith. Imposter syndrome will no doubt creep in, but the fact you've already built products using no-code over the past 30 days, already makes you a builder!


Your journey will only get more exciting from here, and that's what we will be talking about today!

# Task for today ðŸš€


**âš¡ What does Phase 3 look like?**

Now that you have built your first few projects, understood the space more deeply, learnt the most versatile no-code stack and got a feel for what skills or tools you want to learn, you're ready for **Phase 3**.

Whilst **Phase 1** prescribed what you'll be learning each day and **Phase 2** went deeper into a specific tool stack, **Phase 3** leans on the fact that you will have your own interests and reasons for learning to no-code. You may want to build a side project or startup or just be able to take some of the manual tasks off your plate.

Whatever they may be, we want to help you get there.

That's why we've created and are continuing to create modular learning paths for you to pick from as you learn. Think of each path as a block that you can choose to plug into your own personalised 100 day journey, pick n' mix style.

For example, if you want to learn more about automation, you'll be able to pick from a variety of paths (that will last from between 3-10 days) related to that. And once you've completed one path, you'll be presented with another list of paths you can trigger to learn something new.

**âš¡ Reflect on your journey so far**

But first, we should reflect and recognise how far we've come from day one. Find somewhere quiet and anwser the below questions. 

- What have been your key takeaways from this first 30 days?
- What have you enjoyed most about the experience so far?
- What do you want to dive deeper into or learn more about in the coming days and weeks?

Answering these questions will help you process what you've learnt and pinpoint areas that are most interesting to you. This'll make it easier for you to choose which **Phase 3** paths to take.  


**âš¡  Accelerate your Phase 3 experience**

As you enter the next stage of your no-code learning journey, we hope you'll start applying no-code more and more to your own usecases and ideas. You won't just be a no-code builder anymore, you'll become a venture builder. 

This is when community can be a powerful force to keep you accountable, give you feedback on your projects, co-build and sustain momentum towards your goals.

4. Select Email - and then add the 1) email name, 2) subject and 3) sender in the pane that appears.

5. Click on the gray Design email button to add the content of your automatic welcome mail. You can now create your own design, or choose from one of the templates and customize it the way you want with the [drag & drop editor](https://www.mailerlite.com/help/how-to-use-the-drag-and-drop-editor).

6. Once you’re done editing, you can confirm this with the green done editing button to return to finish your workflow. You can find [more information about automation workflows](https://www.mailerlite.com/help/how-to-create-an-automation-workflow) in MailerLite’s knowledge base.

7. When your workflow is finished you can turn it on with the toggle in the pane on the right side. Now every new subscriber will automatically receive a warm welcome 🙂

    **Note**: This automated welcome mail gets only send to new subscribers, but maybe you already had some people on your list before you started this.

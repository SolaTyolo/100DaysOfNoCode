# Managing Tasks - Day36


**Hi! 👋   It’s [Colleen](https://twitter.com/colleenmbrady)**

It’s great to be back here building with you again today. 😀

Today we’re going to work on using Notion to manage tasks — and you’re going to be putting learnings from the past few days into action. It also means fewer videos and pictures.

Before we get started, a lesson I’ve learned while using Notion as a task manager. One can handle tasks in two different ways.....

    1. By including all tasks in one primary table
    2. By having multiple task tables, each focused on a for unique project or area of one’s life


Both approaches work, but each has pros / cons. An advantage of a task table is that everything is in one table and you can have a consistent layout across all tasks. A drawback is that if you end up using “share to” or the extension to add content, you’ll need to spend time tagging content by project for easy sorting. Alternatively, you can create multiple “to do” tables. A potential drawback is that the layout of the tables will diverge over time as you make changes to each one.

In this example, we’re going to create one main task database.

Let’s go build! 🛠️

# Task for today 🚀

📝 **Task type(s)**: Building, Researching

⏲️ **Estimated time**: 25 minutes

🛠️ **Tools**: Notion

👇 **Steps...**

1. Create a database. Let’s call it “db Main Tasks.” Add an icon and cover photo.

2. Start creating fields.

+ Task Name (Text)
+ Status (Relation): While one could use a select field here, setting this field to a linked database gives us options in the future if the tasks table is broken out into unique projects. The options I use are “Today,” “Next Up,” “This Week,” “Completed,” “Not Started,” and “Next Week.”
+ Priority (Select)
+ Due Date (Date)
+ [Days Until Due (Formula)](https://www.redgregory.com/notion/2020/8/12/notion-deadline-tip-count-days-remaining-and-days-overdue) or [Progress Bar (Formula)](https://www.redgregory.com/notion/2021/6/4/17-progress-bar-designs-in-notion)


💡 **Additional ideas**: If you organize work by [themes](https://www.spica.com/blog/themed-days) or habits, you could add columns to capture this information. Or — if you follow the [eat the frog approach](https://www.briantracy.com/blog/time-management/the-truth-about-frogs/), add a checkbox for the most important task that should be done first each day. Extend this even further by creating a goals database and adding a relation field that ties tasks to milestones. Check the [Notion Template Gallery](https://www.notion.so/templates) or do a search on Twitter or Pinterest for more ideas.

3. Enter a handful of tasks in your newly created database. As you start entering information, you may find that a “Project” or “Area of Life” field might be needed.

4. Experiment with formulas and views. Now that you have a table with a few different types of data, [start experimenting with views, sorting, and filtering](https://www.notion.so/help/views-filters-and-sorts). This will be useful when building the landing page of our personal wiki. [Knowing how to use Notion formulas](https://www.notion.so/help/formulas) — like [how to prioritize tasks automatically](https://www.notion.vip/notion-formulas-prioritize-tasks-automatically/) — can make what is on your personal wiki landing page look extra-ordinary.

5. That’s it for today —- almost. Be sure to share what you’ve learnt from today’s email. Get started by using the red button below.

Tomorrow we’ll be returning to work on the “Personal Wiki” page. If you have free time, [do a Google image search for inspiration](https://www.google.com/search?source=univ&tbm=isch&q=notion+dashboard+inspiration).

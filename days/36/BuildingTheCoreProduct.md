Hello there!! 👋

[Lachlan](https://twitter.com/LachlanKirkwood) here again.

At this point in our learning path, we’re ready to start building out the core features of our CRM. In today’s lesson, we’ll create a way to add new customer entries into our CRM. From there, we’ll then build a home page that displays all of the information we have stored on our customers.

# Task for today 🚀
📝 **Task type(s)**: Building

⏲️ **Estimated time**: 30 mins

🛠️ **Tools**: Bubble

👇 **Steps...**

1. **Preparation**

If you’re following the free video course I’d given you access to, I’d recommend watching modules 4 & 5 to understand today’s key lessons.

**Module 4**: This covers the process of adding a new customer entry into your CRM.

**Module 5**: Throughout this module, I explain how to structure your home page to display a list of CRM entries.

2. **Adding new CRM entries**

When it comes to adding new entries into your CRM, you’ll need to create a new page to input this data. On this new page, we’ll add a series of input fields, similar to our user registration page.

From here, we’ll then create a new workflow that’s triggered every time the ‘add customer’ button is clicked.

Within this workflow, we’ll choose the ‘create a new thing’ action. The thing we’ll want to create in our database is a new customer.

When creating this new customer, we’ll match all of our on-page input fields to the relevant data fields in our database.

3. **Displaying customer data** 

Now that we’ve created a way to add new customer entries into our CRM, we can start building out the home page to display this data.

We’ll start by creating a new page within our editor. This page will be our home page in our CRM.

On this page, we’ll add a repeating group element, then have this repeating group display a list of all the customers stored in our database.

After configuring the data source of this repeating group, we can now add a series of text elements to display the data stored for each customer.

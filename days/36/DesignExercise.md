# Design Exercise - Day36


Hello again üëã

[Mark]() here.

Today we will walk through a simple excercise using the design principles you've learnt so far, for practice. If you did the preparation in the previous step, you should have something in mind to design, some content to use, and picked a design tool.


# Task for today üöÄ

üìù **Task type(s)**: Designing

‚è≤Ô∏è **Estimated time**: 30mins-1hr

üõ†Ô∏è **Tools**: Your design tool of choice (see the list in the last email)

üëá **Steps...**

In this short assignment, the objective will be to create a design mockup of one page or screen ‚Äì as you planned in the previous step. The idea **IS NOT** to make a fancy, polished visual design here. The priority is to **practice using fundamentals** that will give your design a foundation in usability. It does not matter if your end design doesn‚Äôt look amazing at the end, you‚Äôre doing this to learn üôÇ

**Tools you will need**:

- Your design tool of choice ‚Äì see the list in the Preparation step. If you're not strong with something like Figma, try using Canva, Keynote, Google Slides, or anything else where you can control layout positioning and text styling.
  
1. **Set up your design space**

If you haven't already, set up your work space in whatever tool you're using.

- Set up a blank pages / screens / frames for both **Desktop size** and - **Mobile size**. Some tools have pre-sets for these. Don‚Äôt worry about precise pixel wdiths at this point.
- If your tools allows, set up a **simple column grid** (for web pages, use roughly 6-12 columns, with a little white margin each side). If your tool doesn‚Äôt give this option, draw boxes, colour them really faintly then lock them in place (I did this in the Google Slides template)
- In the last email, I gave links to templates I‚Äôve created with grids included if you need them.

2. **Add content**

Here you're going to **just dump everything down quickly**, without paying attention to stylings or layout. Place each element roughly where it is on your plan.

    1. Add your text and image content, roughly where it should be on the page.
    2. Add each part of the text in a separate text boxes - not in one long box. This way it‚Äôs ready to style and move about.
    3. Don't style anything yet or get involved in the layout. You‚Äôre positioning content ready only.

3. **Explore key design concepts**

Now it‚Äôs time to **create your design mockup** with your content, focussing here on the key principles we talked about in an earlier step:

- Grids & alignment
- Visual hierarchy
- Consistency & pattern
- Spacing
- Accessibility
- Mobile


üí° Tip: I tend to do this in **2-3 phases of detailing**, as the key principles overlap and affect each other

After each phase of detailing, it‚Äôs important to review your page for areas to improve. Go back over the principles, looking for ways you could do better, or that you may have missed.

You should end up with a layout that feels easier to use or read.

If you‚Äôre not sure, show it to a friend to get feedback.

You can see even my eample here (done in approax 40mins) isn‚Äôt pixel perfect, but it has the main usability principles in place.

In the next step I‚Äôll show you ways you can dive deeper and learn more. So you could come back to your mockup and keep improving it, to learn. There are no time limits on how long you should spend on a design.

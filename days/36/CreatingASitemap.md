# Creating a Sitemap


Hello there!! üëã

[Harold](https://twitter.com/hdkstr) here again. 

Today we're going to create a sitemap as a visual overview of what you'll be building in Softr üôÇ! Just like with the database scheme, this provides you with a visual overview of your project so you won't get lost between your pages later. 

# Task for today üöÄ
üìù **Task type**: Planning

üß± **No-Code Learning Sprint**: Research & Building

‚è≤Ô∏è **Estimated time**: 30 mins

üõ†Ô∏è **Tools**: [Whimsical](https://whimsical.com/signup)

üëá **Steps...**

1. **Open up [this sitemap](https://whimsical.com/sitemap-4-ways-XczEccfYYqFVsshZfM1V8T) template in Whimsical**

+ Remove the gray subsections from the template (only keep the purple ones)
+ Rename Home into the name of your project (e.g. Website), and give it another color if you'd like


2. **Design your sitemap**
+ Now think of the pages you want to include in your website, for example: Home, Tools, Products, Makers and Contact. For every page you'll need one column in the sitemap. Add or remove extra colors if needed, and put the names in the first shapes of every column (the purple rectangles).
+ Now for every page, add all the [blocks](https://docs.softr.io/building-blocks) you want to include on that specific page in Softr. You can do this by selecting the first shape in a column and then clicking on the option that appears below that:

+ For example, on the home page you'll probably need a [header block](https://docs.softr.io/building-blocks/header), a [hero block](https://docs.softr.io/building-blocks/hero), a [feature block](https://docs.softr.io/building-blocks/feature), a [list block](https://docs.softr.io/building-blocks/listings) and a footer block. **Note**: üí° The header and the footer blocks can be used as default for all pages. So you only have to add them to the home page üôÇ
+ I always give these blocks a different color in the sitemap, to distinguish them from the pages (for example blue)
+ Use a [list detail block](https://docs.softr.io/building-blocks/listing-details) on the detail pages, like the tool details page in my example below. 

üí° To give yourself extra clarity, you could link blocks from different columns together that you plan to connect to eachother. I use dotted lines for this, in a light color.

3. **Complete your sitemap**

You should now be ready to complete your sitemap. Once it's done, it should look something like the below example. But also keep in mind that you may want different pages or blocks for your own resource directory.

4. **Share your progress**

Now you're ready to implement this in Softr tomorrow. You can use the sitemap as a checklist to make sure you've added all the pages and blocks that you had planned too.

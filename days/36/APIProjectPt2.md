# API Project Pt 2 - Day36


Hello there!! 👋

[Marc](https://twitter.com/MrMarcFletcher) here again.

Today is the last day the the API learning path. We'll complete our waitlist landing page by building the website or ‘front end’. My preferred tool for this is Carrd.co, it’s a reliable single-page website builder with lots of features, awesome customer support and is extremely good value. You’ll need a Pro subscription for this build but don’t worry if you don’t have one, you can nab a free 7 day trial.


# Task for today 🚀
📝 **Task type(s)**: Follow along build

⏲️ **Estimated time**: 30 mins

🛠️ **Tools**: [Airtable](https://www.airtable.com/) [Carrd](https://carrd.co/)

👇 **Steps...**

Yesterday, we got our waitlist website database in place using Airtable. Now we need a presence on the web where visitors can submit their contact info which we’ll store and use at some point in the future to bombard them with amazing offers. Our website will be simple. There will be a form and a thank you message. That’s all we’ll need. When a visitor fills in the form and pushes the button, their data will be sent to the the Airtable API and stored on our database, the website will then show a message of thanks.

We’ll need to get some values from our Airtable API document which will be used in configuring our Carrd form. This will be, the API key, the Base ID, and the name of our database table. Once we’re set up, we’re going to launch our website and test out the form! Let’s go!

After watching the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7soStRcAA0), your task is to set up your own website and configure a form. When you’re done, launch the website and try the form out. The form data will appear in your database! Magic!

Following on from yesterday, If you’re still feeling ambitious, try adding some more fields to your form and database. Be careful when configuring the Airtable field data type, they must be compatible with the Carrd form data types. Go for it!

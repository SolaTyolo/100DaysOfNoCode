# Create a Project Tracker - Day12


Hello there!! 👋

Day 12 - LET'S GO!

# Task for today 🚀



Today we'll be creating a personalised project tracker. 

[Coda](https://coda.io/welcome), very much like Notion, offers a world of possibility. It's like a Google doc, Google sheets, Trello and much more combined into one tool. You can create everything from a to-do list, CRM to a fully published site. [This](https://coda.io/gallery) template gallery will give you a feel. 

Anyway, today, we'll be creating a simple project tracker like [this](https://coda.io/@ben-at-coda/basic-project-management) to help you keep track of your tasks.

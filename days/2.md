# Build a Digital Journal - Day2


Hello there!! 👋

Welcome back - Day 2 is HERE and we have something exciting for you. 

# Task for today 🚀


Today is the day you'll be getting your hands on some no-code tools and building your first project! 

As we'll be learning consistently everyday for the next 100 days, I thought it'd make sense for us to create something where we can track our progress and wins along the way. 

That's why we'll be creating a digital journal! 

🧱 Project: No-Code Journal

⏲️ Estimated time: 29 mins

🛠️ Tools: [Airtable](https://www.airtable.com/), [Carrd](https://carrd.co/)

👇 Steps...

1. Firstly, follow [this step by step guide](https://mynocodejournal.com/#airtable) to set up your journal using Airtable. 

2. Now, using Carrd, create your own website. Follow along [here](https://mynocodejournal.com/#carrd) to see how. This will essentially be the 'frontend' to the journal you have just created in Airtable. 

3. Once you have built your website, it's time to make it easier for yourself to track your no-code learning journey. [Here's how](https://mynocodejournal.com/#notifications).  

4. Congrats! You should now be ready to share your first project! Hit the red button below. 

# Sneak Peek 👀

Tomorrow we'll be creating our first automation to take some of those manual tasks off your plate.

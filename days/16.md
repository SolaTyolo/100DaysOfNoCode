# Airtable Fundamentals - Day16


Hello there!! 👋

Day 16 - LET's DO THIS! 

#  Task for today 🚀


Before we start our learning for the day, I wanted to share with you how we'll be teaching each tool in Phase 2 over the next two weeks. We've designed the no-code learning sprint which can be broken into five key stages. This can be used to learn any no-code tool. It works as follows...

**1. Research**

This is the stage to get familiar with the tool, what it's best for, grasp some of the basic concepts, feel comfortable with the interface, the technical jargon used and pick up some time saving tips + tricks.

**2. Follow**

This is the stage to begin applying your basic knowledge of the tool on an actual project but with the safety of being able to follow along step by step. Mirroring an expert building a real project will allow you to pick up good habits in building as well as embed the core concepts you were introduced to in the 'research phase'. 

**3. Build**

This is when you become a creator. Whether you create a dummy project or your own idea, the research and learning you have done, will let you become a builder. So, get building! Once you have your first project in a tool, your confidence will rise and you'll be itching to create more.

**4. Launch (optional)**

This is the phase you share what you've built with the world. Now, this is an optional phase, but one that will make you a more well rounded maker. **"If you can build and sell, you're unstoppable"**. Use this phase to become a dual threat. Sharing your work is also is a great feedback loop aswell, to help you improve your future projects, whether that's related to the copy on your site, the UX or something else. There are a few levels on which you can share your work, so do what works for you. 1. share with a closed group of trusted friends 2. share within a community your in 3. share on twitter or a social network 4. share on Product Hunt.

**5. Reflect**

This is the phase that you take stock on what you've learnt, how you felt, what areas you'd like to improve in and just on whether you'd like to continue using this tool. When you're a few sprints in, it's great to be able to flick back to your reflections on past sprints, so that you can take these learnings into your future sprints for optimised learning.

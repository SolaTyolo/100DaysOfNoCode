Hello there!! 👋

Day 20, here we go! 


# Task for today 🚀
Today we'll be building a project step by step in Notion. 

📝 **Task type**: Building

🧱 **No-Code Learning Sprint**: Follow

⏲️ **Estimated time**: 30 mins

🛠️ **Tools**: [Notion](https://www.notion.so/)

👇 Steps...

1. Follow the  [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV6-U1X4hJM&t=7s) step by step to build your own financial tracker in Notion. 

By building this, you'll learn some more advanced Notion features such as [rollups](https://www.notion.so/guides/using-relation-and-rollup-properties), [formulas](https://www.notion.vip/formulas/), [databases](https://www.notion.so/help/guides/creating-a-database) and more. 


If you'd like to see part two of this build, you can find it here. But doing just part 1 is absolutely fine for the purposes of this exercise.

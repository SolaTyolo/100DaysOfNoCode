# Create a Tweet Scheduler - Day14


Hello there!! üëã

Day 14 - you've made it through two full weeks of no-code learning...that's awesome!! 

Today is also a special day, as it's the last day of the first phase of this #100DaysOfNoCode journey. We'll go into more detail in tomorrow's email, but essentially phase two will allow you to dive deeper into the most versatile no-code stack and give you the fundamental building blocks to create most (if not all) of your ideas with no-code! 

# Task for today üöÄ

Just to recap, this week you've built...

A mobile app ‚û°Ô∏è to showcase your lists of information
A voice app ‚û°Ô∏è to communicate with Alexa / Google voice
A personal wiki ‚û°Ô∏è to organise your life
A project tracker ‚û°Ô∏è to keep on top of your work
A wireframe ‚û°Ô∏è to make your ideas usable
All without writing a single line of code!

And for these projects, you've used a total of 6 no-code tools including [Notion](https://www.notion.so/), [Voiceflow](https://www.voiceflow.com/), [Coda](https://coda.io/), [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), [Glide](https://www.glideapps.com/) and [Mailerlite](https://www.mailerlite.com/)! That's pretty impressive!

üìù Task type: Writing

üß± Project: Reflect on your 2nd week

‚è≤Ô∏è Estimated time: 20-25 mins

üõ†Ô∏è Tools: [Airtable](https://www.airtable.com/)

üëá Steps...

1. Find somewhere quiet and write down your thoughts on the below three questions...

What were your key takeaways from this 2nd week?
What did you enjoy most from this 2nd week?
What do you want to dive deeper into or learn more about in the coming days and weeks?
Answering these questions will help you process what you've learnt and pinpoint tools or topics that are most interesting to you.

2. To make sure your friends keep holding you accountable and as a way to leave a digital reference that you can look back on, share your answers with others! I recommend writing this as a mini Twitter thread.

3. Build your own social media scheduler with Airtable to schedule your reflection tweet. Follow [this 7 min](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMmWUNHf4QY) video to see how.

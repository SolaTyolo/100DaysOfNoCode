# Phase 2 of Your Journey - Day15


Hello there!! 👋

Day 15 - we've hit the first BIG milestone! Huge congrats!

Today is the day we shift gears and enter the next phase of your #100DaysOfNoCode journey.

#  Task for today 🚀


📝 **Task type**: Reading / planning

🧱 **Project**: Plan & set yourself up for Phase 2 success

⏲️ **Estimated time**: 20 mins

🛠️ **Tools**: N/A

👇 Steps...

1. Read the below to understand what you'll be learning over the next 20-25 days. 

Phase 2 is about cementing your skills and going deeper into some handpicked tools. One of the biggest problems beginners face is knowing which tools to learn and build with, so we're going to make that decision for you, at least over the next two weeks, until we enter Phase 3 where you'll be able to choose your own learning pathway. The 5 tools we'll be learning in this Phase 2 are Notion, Airtable, Zapier, Softr and Glide.

By focusing on these tools, you'll learn the most versatile no-code stack. That's because you'll be able to automate things (with Zapier), organise everything (with Notion), build mobile apps (with Glide), store all your data (with Airtable) and create web apps (with Softr). Not to mention, these tools integrate nicely with eachother too! Most (if not all) your ideas will be buildable using this stack.

Although we've already used some of these tools in our first 15 days, we'll be going deeper into each of them, so you can begin leveraging their advanced functionality and start walking the path of the power user! 


2. Once you've understood Phase 2, it's time to set yourself up for success. Building a learning habit is super tough, and requires a strong interconnection between you as the learner, the daily learning you're doing and the environment you're doing this in. We're often missing one of these ingredients to sustain our learning habit.

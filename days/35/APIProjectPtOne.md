# API Project Pt 1 - Day35

Hello there!! 👋

[Marc](https://twitter.com/MrMarcFletcher) here again.

Today we're going to start building a waitlist landing page. This will enable us to demonstrate move data from a website to a database using API requests. We’ll begin with the backend (database) that will act as a repository for the information our waitlist website will collect. Once built, we’ll create a record in our new database using an API POST request to learn about what happens ‘behind the no-code curtain’. Hold-tight!

# Task for today 🚀

📝 **Task type(s)**: Follow along build

⏲️ **Estimated time**: 30 mins

🛠️ **Tools**:  [Hoppscotch](https://hoppscotch.io/cn) [Punk API](https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2) [Airtable](https://www.airtable.com/)

👇 **Steps...**

A great starting point for your no-code project will be a simple website that allows visitors to joint a waitlist so that they can be informed of a launch at some future time. For the remainder of this API learning path, we’ll build our own waitlist website and connect it to a database that will store all of the visitor’s information. We’ll make use of the Airtable API to transport the visitors information from the website form to the database.

After watching the video, your task is to set up your own database and then use [Hoppscotch](https://hoppscotch.io/) to create a database record with a POST request.

If you’re feeling ambitious, try adding some more fields to your database and edit the JSON in the Request body accordingly! Go for it!

That's it for today


# Sneak Peek 👀

Tomorrow’s activity will be to build the front end (website) of your waitlist landing page. We’ll build a form for visitors to fill in. We’ll then test and launch!

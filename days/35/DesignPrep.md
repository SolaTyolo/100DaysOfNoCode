# Design Prep - Day35

Hello again üëã

[Mark](https://twitter.com/markbowley) here.

In an upcoming step, I will walk you through a simple exercise to practice some of the key concepts. Today we're going to talk about what preparation you should do and think about before jumping into any design mockups.

# Task for today üöÄ

üìù **Task type(s)**: Preparation

‚è≤Ô∏è **Estimated time**: 20mins-1hr

üõ†Ô∏è **Tools**: Paper, or a digital wireframing tool (see below)

üëá **Steps...**


1. **First decide on what you will design**

If you haven‚Äôt already got anything in mind you‚Äôd like to do a design mockup for, pick something simple with a clear purpose or goal to work through the exercise ‚Äì for exampe a **landing page**, or an **onboarding screen**, etc. It could be something for your MVP, or just a fake page just for practice.

2. **Do some high level planning**

Next, create a very rough (low-fidelity) sketch or wireframe. This will help you plan what goes roughly where, as a starting point.

- Add the main sections and elements you‚Äôre going to include.
- A standard sheet of paper (A4 or similar) will do, or use any other quick method you like ‚Äì a whiteboard, Google Slides, [wireframe.cc](https://wireframe.cc/) etc.
- When you‚Äôve done that, create another for a mobile view.
- A standard sheet of paper cut in half (vertically) would work here. Here's a free printable [A4 sheet with dot grid](https://www.septemberleather.com/blogs/sp/free-printable-dot-grid-paper-for-bullet-journal).
- On the right here is an example I‚Äôve quickly done with pencil and paper.


3. **Prepare some basic content**

    Prepare at least a first draft of your text content before moving on to desiging a mockup (it‚Äôs really hard to design with placeholder text).

- Don't worry about it being perfect, just so long as you have something to start with.
- If you're really struggling just use some [placeholder text](https://www.loremipzum.com/en/text-generator) at the right kind of lengths.
  
    Likewise if your design will need them, make sure you have some images to work with. As with the text, don't worry about these being perfect to start with.

4. **Pick some fonts and colours**

    Choosing some colours and fonts up front will save time while designing.

- **Pick 1-2 fonts** - ideally it can help to have a display font and a functional font (they can be the same one if there are a good range of weights). Display fonts would normally be more styled than the functional. Try to use fonts that pair nicely ‚Äì there‚Äôs no end of web pages on this if you search "Google font pairings", or use my quick guides on [font pairings](https://www.notion.so/Lesson-42-resources-ec15b0bf625044ae8cd58a1bba4b4c18)and [go-to fonts](https://www.notion.so/Lesson-13-resources-27b314106712448eaf771011dc8e9937).
- **Pick 2-3 colours** - one for Heavy use (deep/dark), one as a Complement to it (neutral/light), and an Accent (bright/vivid). Don't worry too much about this though as you could just design in black+white, for speed.
  
5. **Choose a design tool**

    You will need a tool to create a design mockup in. Below are professional tools ‚Äì if you're already using any, stick with that. If you want to start using one, use Figma but have a play around to get familar before you try to design in it (use my starter [template](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1041012449204223084)).


These are all Pro tools but are free or have a free trial:

+ [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) (Grab my Figma template [here](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1041012449204223084))
+ [Whimsical](https://whimsical.com/)
+ [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/)
+ [Marvel](https://marvelapp.com/)
+ [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html)
+ [Proto](https://proto.io/)


If you don't feel compfortable using these, you could get away with just using something like **Canva** or **Google Slides**. You will have less control over detailing, but they will get you most of the way there.

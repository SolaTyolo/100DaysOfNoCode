# Create a Newletter Landing Page - Day35

Hello there!! 👋

[Harold](https://twitter.com/hdkstr) here again. How are you today?

Ready to share your newsletter with others? Let’s create a landing page to get the word out and offer people a way to sign-up.

# Task for today 🚀

Now our account got approved yesterday and our sending domain is authenticated, it’s time to share our newsletter idea and collect subscribers before we’ll send our first issue. Therefore, we’re going to build a landing page now.

To build our landing page, we’re using Mailerlite. But if you prefer to use another No-code builder for your landing page, then of course that’s no problem. You can easily connect your MailerLite account with tools like [Carrd](https://carrd.co/docs/forms/setting-up-a-mailerlite-signup-form) and [Softr](https://docs.softr.io/integrations/mailerlite).

Note: A special landing page for your newsletter is not always needed, you can also [embed](https://www.mailerlite.com/help/how-to-create-an-embedded-form) a MailerLite form into your existing website or use MailerLite’s [API](https://www.mailerlite.com/help/where-to-find-the-mailerlite-api-key-and-documentation) to connect your own sign-up form to MailerLite.

📝 **Task type(s)**: Building

⏲️ **Estimated time**: 30 minutes

🛠️ **Tools**: Mailerlite

👇 **Steps...**

1. Navigate to Sites and click on the orange button to **create a landing page**

2. Follow MailerLite’s instructions to 1) give your LP a name, 2) select the subscriber group* you want to add your subscribers to and 3) to choose a template for your page

    **Note**: When you open an account, Mailerlite automatically generates the first subscriber group for you. If you want to change the name, or add a different group, you can navigate to Subscribers > Groups

3. Now you can design your page just like you want with the drag & drop builder of MailerLite. Click on an element of the template to adjust its content and settings. And of course MailerLite is [happy to help](https://www.mailerlite.com/help/how-to-create-a-landing-page) you get started with this.

4. Besides the landing page, don’t forget the **success page**: the page your subscribers will see after they subscribed to your newsletter. You can find this in the middle of the black header, at the top.

5. Once you finished your design, click save and publish to proceed. Now you can 1) adjust the URL, 2) add a Favicon and 3) manage your a) SEO, b) social and c) analytics settings. When you’re done, click save and continue to proceed to the LP’s dashboard.

    **Note**: In addition to the settings mentioned above, you can also connect your landing page to a custom domain - just like with the sending domains we did yesterday. However, this is a paid feature. [Read here](https://www.mailerlite.com/help/how-to-add-a-custom-domain-to-landing-pages-and-websites) how you can do this.

6. In your landing page’s dashboard you can enable double [opt-in](https://www.mailerlite.com/help/how-to-use-double-opt-in-when-collecting-subscribers) (to improve the quality of your mailing list) and view your statistics. You can also add automation here to welcome your subscribers, which we’re going to do tomorrow.

7. Now you’re ready to share your landing page. 

# Sneak Peek 👀

Now the first subscribers are getting in (hopefully) it’s time to send them a welcome mail tomorrow (automatically).

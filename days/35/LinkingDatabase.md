# Linking Databases - Day35


Hello Nocode Friend! 👋

It’s [Colleen](https://twitter.com/colleenmbrady) again.

Today we’re going to create a space in Notion to track tutorials, courses, forum posts, articles, etc. on a topic that we want to learn. For our purposes, we’re going to create a “nocode learning system.” Please adapt this to your needs. You can make it more specific by focusing on one tool or pick an entirely different topic, like learning how to create amazing YouTube videos. What’s important is to pick a topic that interests you.

As part of today’s build, we’re going to create [linked databases](https://www.notion.so/help/linked-databases). A powerful feature, linked databases, allow you to link information throughout your Notion workspace.

Let’s start creating! 🛠️


# Task for today 🚀
📝 **Task type(s)**: Following Along, Building

⏲️ **Estimated time**: 25 minutes

🛠️ **Tools**: Notion

👇 **Steps...**

### Part 1: Setting up a reference area and a tools database

Think of a reference area as an information kiosk. It’s a place with key information, but not something that is accessed that much.

Here are the steps to follow....

1. [Create a new page](https://www.notion.so/help/create-your-first-page)

2. Give your page a name. In our case, we’re going to use “Reference.”

3. Add an emoji and cover photo.

4. [Create a subpage](https://www.notion.so/help/create-a-subpage) that is a [database](https://www.notion.so/help/create-a-database).

5. Give this new page a name. Let’s use “db No-Code Tools”.

💡 The acronym “db” stands for “landing page.” [This is a variation of a tip from Khe Hy of RadReads](https://radreads.co/the-top-notion-tips-tricks-and-keyboard-shortcuts/). Using prefixes can be useful when using Notion’s “share to” feature, especially as you have more content and are only able to see a list of page names.

6. Add names of tools to the table. Start by adding tool names, like Airtable, Glide, Notion, Softr, and Zapier as well as any other tools you are interested in learning.

💡 Once you’ve created your database, Notion will automatically add a link to sub-pages.

If you don’t see a link to a sub-page on a page where you’ve added content — like on a landing page — scroll to the bottom of the page. Your links may merely have been hiding. See what I mean [here](https://www.loom.com/share/9cf3fc8f3fe944f98fcd8007aeb7ccf7). 

### Part 2: Creating a Learning No-Code Landing Page

Let’s create a landing page to capture your no-code learnings.

Here are the steps to follow....

1. [Create a new page](https://www.notion.so/help/create-your-first-page). This will be its own page, separate from the Reference Area.

2. Give your page a name. In our case, we’re going to use “lp Learning No-Code”

💡 The acronym “lp” stands for “landing page.” Adding in “lp” is not a hard and fast rule — I leave off “lp” on highly important pages to make them stand out a bit more or in cases where a page just consists of links auto-generated by Notion.

3. Select an emoji and cover photo

### Part 3: Creating a Tutorials Database

Let’s start tracking tutorials and other source you would like to learn from in its own base.

Here are the steps to follow....

1. [Create a subpage](https://www.notion.so/help/create-a-subpage) that is a [database](https://www.notion.so/help/create-a-database).

2. Give this new page a name. Let’s use “db No-Code Tutorials”. The acronym “db” stands for “database.” We’re going to the following fields:

+ Name (Text Field): Name of the tutorial
+ Link (URL Field): URL for tutorial source
+ Status (Single Select): If you’ve completed the tutorial or not.
+ Tools (Relation): This links to “db No-Code Tools.” By linking to an existing database instead of using a select or multi-select field, we can have one master Tools list that is used in multiple places.
+ Creator (Single Select): If it’s important to you to know who created a tutorial, add it here.
  
Now that a basic structure is in place, feel free to add more fields like star rating, priority, type of tutorial, etc. Go through the above steps using [this quick video](https://www.loom.com/share/0d063b6c40994762b14d5fe27a6853c5). 

### Part 4: Creating a No-Code Build Ideas Database

Repeat the steps you’ve just learned for creating a new page with a database. This time, the database is for ideas and projects you want to pursue with no-code. Include a relational column that links to “db No-Code Tools.” You could even add a column linking to “db No-Code Tutorials” for tracking tutorials that will help you implement your ideas.

### Part 5: Updating "lp Learning No-Code" 

Let’s go back to the “lp Learning No-Code” page. Notion has already added links to the sub-pages. Overall, it’s a blank canvas. Spend some time updating it to be more useful to you. Add bookmarks to commonly visited pages, inspirational quotes, etc.

💡 As you nest pages, Notion will automatically add links to subpages. If you ever think a link is missing, scroll to the bottom of the page. If the link you are looking for is at the bottom, you can grab it and place elsewhere on the page.

This is also a great time to practice [adding in a linked table and filtering it to be just right](https://www.notion.so/help/guides/using-linked-databases). 🤌

That’s it for today

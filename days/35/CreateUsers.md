# Create Users - Day35


Hello there!! üëã

Lachlan here again.

Before we start building out the core features of our Salesforce CRM, I wanted to take the time to explain how we can register user accounts for team members.

Unlike some no-code tools, Bubble allows you to register user accounts, then store user data all within one place. This saves you from having to rely on third-party tools, as well as the individual costs associated with them.

# Task for today üöÄ

üìù **Task type(s)**: Building

‚è≤Ô∏è **Estimated time**: 20 mins

üõ†Ô∏è **Tools**: Bubble

üëá **Steps...**

1. **Preparation**

If you‚Äôre following the free video course I‚Äôd given you access to in my first email, you‚Äôll see that there‚Äôs a dedicated module ([module 3](https://lachlankirkwood1.podia.com/courses/how-to-build-a-salesforce-crm-clone-with-no-code-using-bubble-video-course/884915-3-registering-team-member-accounts/2625425-lesson-3-registering-team-member-accounts)) for learning how to register user accounts.

Throughout this module, I cover the step-by-step instructions in as much detail as possible.

2. **Building your UI**

When it comes to registering user accounts, you‚Äôll first need to create a page within Bubble where users can add their account details.

On this page, you can use a combination of input fields to outline what information you‚Äôd like the team member to provide. Within my tutorial, I‚Äôve included a dedicated field to register the users name, email, password, profile photo, and account type.

3. **Building the workflow**

After building the UI of the registration page, it‚Äôs time to make this feature functional by creating our first workflow. We‚Äôll be triggering this workflow when the register button on our page is clicked.

Within this workflow, we‚Äôll choose the ‚Äòsign the user up‚Äô action. From here, we‚Äôll then store all of the data within our input fields into the new user account we‚Äôre creating.

Additionally, we‚Äôll add a final step to our workflow that runs after our new user account has been registered. Within this workflow step, we‚Äôll redirect users to a new home page (called CRM) in our app.

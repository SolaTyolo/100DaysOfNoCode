# Build a Wiki

Hello there!! 👋

Day 10...this feels like a milestone, so let's celebrate it! 

[Adalo](https://click.mlflow.com/link/c/) is a no-code mobile app builder, and they are giving 3 months of pro membership to you all. To redeem it, use this code: **lNZLr0p2** at checkout. Note: this perk expires on 12th Jan and the price will not change on the UI when you add the code, but the perk will still be applied.

It's been uber inspiring to see everyone's progress updates on Twitter (and elsewhere) each day. **Keep em' comin**!!

Remember, if you maintain your streak of sharing progress everyday, you'll be eligible for more no-code perks. A bit like [Squid Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid_Game); the longer you last, the greater the prize 😅!

P.S Day 15 is the next mini milestone to hit. From that day onwards, we'll be shaking things up so that you can begin diving deeper into a specfic toolkit. 

# Task for today 🚀

Today we'll be creating a personal wiki.

What!? 

It's essentially a space to organise your life. Your ideas, goals, projects, shopping lists, journal and more. Check out the [template gallery](https://www.notion.so/Notion-Template-Gallery-181e961aeb5c4ee6915307c0dfd5156d) for the tool we'll be using today. This should give you a feel for scope of things you can create. 

Frances captures it well...


With possibility comes optionality, which can also come with feelings of overwhelm i.e. where do I start?!

I hope the below proves to be a good answer 😉.

📝 **Task type**: Mini (guided) challenge

🧱 **Project**: Create a personal wiki

⏲️ **Estimated time**: 20-30 mins

🛠️ **Tools**: [Notion](https://notion.so/)

👇 Steps...

1. First, familiarise yourself with Notion by watching [this mini series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTahLEX3NXo&list=PLzaYMdbJMZW0gYyfNhL0sHheU5WR2YKE1) of six short videos. 

2. Now create an account with Notion and open it up. When you press the <code>/ command</code> you'll be presented with a list of blocks to add to your pages, all of which can be re-ordered, re-sized, re-designed and often configured in a customisable way. It's like digital lego.

3. Follow [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2G-uVDB28A) to put the building blocks of your personal wiki in place. Treat this as your dashboard and then within each page, you can add extra utility. For example, if you have a book page, you can add a reading list and tracker within that page. 

4. To add this, you'll need to create your first inline database. Follow [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzHBSxiWGIw) to see how. This database will feel very similar to what you have already created in Airtable so far. And this is the beauty of Notion - you're doc is not just a doc anymore. Instead of having to write your list of books as bullet points, instead they can be records in your database, which can be filtered, grouped, sorted and viewed in pretty much anyway you like. 

5. As this will be your digital home, you can start to make it feel like your own by adding emojis, cover photos for each page, gallery views for your databases and more. [Read](https://www.notion.so/help/customize-and-style-your-content) this to prettify your pages.

# Zapier Mini Challenge - Day24

Hello there!! 👋

Day 24, here we go! 

# Task for today 🚀


📝 **Task type**: Building

🧱 **No-Code Learning Sprint**: Build

⏲️ **Estimated time**: 30 mins

🛠️ **Tools**: [Zapier](https://zapier.com/)

👇 **Steps...**

1. Build your own automation in Zapier. 

You can't just start building an automation without knowing what you want to automate. So first you need to think of a manual task that takes you a long time each week. And before you decide, keep in mind this quote from Bill Gates...

**"The first rule of any technology used in a business is that automation applied to an efficient operation will magnify the efficiency. The second is that automation applied to an inefficient operation will magnify the inefficiency"** - Bill Gates

Now use a tool like [Whimsical](https://whimsical.com/a) to visually map out the process you're automating and use [this automation cheat sheet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gIErIXDVk7xIkzpwGjrLHkKRl_lFpGvz/view) to help you here. 

To push yourself, try to automate a process that will need to use the following Zapier features: 

+ [Schedulers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IjP1aeefL0)
+ [Formatters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JG7-owzK5Ck)
+ [Filters](https://zapier.com/help/create/customize/add-conditions-to-zaps-with-filters)
+ [Paths](https://zapier.com/help/create/customize/add-branching-logic-to-zaps-with-paths) (note: this feature is only avalaible on Zapier paid plans)
  
2. Once built, it's time to **Share** it with the world! Remember this is a key step in our no-code learning sprint. It's a way for you to get feedback, inspire others and mark this day with a digital reference point for you to look back on. 

3. To close this learning sprint, **Reflection** is key, especially as we'll be focusing on another tool tomorrow. Ask yourself, what you enjoyed about the tool, where you might use it in the future and what areas of it would you like to dive deeper into.

# DIY Project (Airtable) - Day18


Hello there!! 👋

Day 18, here we go! 

Yesterday we ticked off the **Follow** stage to build a CRM, with the help of a step by step video. Today we're in the **build** stage. That means we're removing the stabilisers and giving you a challenge to complete, to apply your learning! 

Before we move on, here's a nice little quote from James Clear (again!)...

**"Success is the product of daily habits—not once-in-a-lifetime transformations".**

# Task for today 🚀


Today is not about me telling you what to build (I think I've done enough of that over the past two weeks 😅). Instead, I'll leave that up to your imagination within the realms of some healthy guidelines. 

📝 **Task type**: Building challenge

🧱 **No-Code Learning Sprint**: Build

⏲️ **Estimated time**: 30 mins

🛠️ **Tools**: [Airtable](https://www.airtable.com/)

👇 Challenge...


1. Build something in Airtable that includes the following features: 
+ [Linked records](https://support.airtable.com/hc/en-us/articles/206452848-How-to-link-records-in-Airtable)
+ [Formulas](https://support.airtable.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041339834-The-essentials-of-Airtable-formulas)
+ [Views](https://support.airtable.com/hc/en-us/articles/202624989-Guide-to-views)
+ [Lookups](https://support.airtable.com/hc/en-us/articles/360042312194-Lookup-field-overview)
+ [Filtering](https://support.airtable.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003695134-Guide-to-filtering-records-using-conditions)
+ [Grouping](https://support.airtable.com/hc/en-us/articles/221747587-Guide-to-grouped-records)
  
Think of these features as ingredients to your recipe. If you're struggling to know what to cook, check [this](https://www.airtable.com/inspiration) out for inspiration or Airtable's very own [universe](https://www.airtable.com/universe)!

Try not to spend any longer than 30 mins. 

2. Once built, it's time to **Share** it with the world! Remember this is a key step in our no-code learning sprint. It's a way for you to get feedback, inspire others and mark this day with a digital reference point for you to look back on. Use the red button below. 

3. To close this learning sprint, **Reflection** is key, especially as we'll be focusing on another tool tomorrow. Ask yourself, what you enjoyed about the tool, where you might use it in the future and what areas of it would you like to dive deeper into.

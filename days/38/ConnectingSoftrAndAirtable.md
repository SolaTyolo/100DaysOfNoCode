# Connecting Softr and Airtable - Day38

Hello there!! üëã

[Harold](https://twitter.com/hdkstr) here again. 

Today, we're going to connect our Softr site with Airtable.

Before starting, make sure to open up the Airtable base you created at the start of this learning path and add some data into it. 

# Task for today üöÄ

üìù **Task type**: Building

üß± **No-Code Learning Sprint**: Building

‚è≤Ô∏è **Estimated time**: 30 mins

üõ†Ô∏è **Tools**: [Softr](https://www.softr.io/), [Airtable](https://www.airtable.com/)

üëá **Steps...**

1. **Connect Airtable with Softr**

Watch [this mini video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMM4kYf0ldM&t=28s) for context, before following the below steps...

- Select the list block you've added yesterday
- Click on the yellow button in the menu that appears on the right side (Setup Airtable)
- Grab your Airtable API key from your account page in Airtable, paste it in Softr and connect ‚ö°Ô∏è 
  
2. **Add fields**

Now you can add whatever information you want to show up on your list block:

- First select the correct **table** from Airtable (for example Tools for the page where you want to show a list of No-code tools)
- Select the right **view** from Airtable, and decide in which order you want to present (**sort**) your records
- Now go to the **list item fields** section and select the fields you want to show in your list block. List blocks come with some pre-defined fields, but if you don't want to use these, you can toggle them off and add new fields yourself.
- Then map your fields to the right fields from Airtable, making sure you've selected the right **types** (e.g, text or image) everywhere.


3. **Add extras**

Softr gives you additional options to customise what information is displayed on list blocks for your users, with inline and conditional filtering. 

If you want to filter your list, there are two types of filters you can add now:

- **Inline filters** - when you want to provide some filter options to your visitors, so they can filter your list themselves ([instructions here](https://docs.softr.io/building-blocks/listings#inline-filters))
- **Conditional filters** - if you only want to show a selection of your list, and hide the rest for your visitors ([instructions here](https://docs.softr.io/memberships/list-conditional-filters)). 

üí° **A note about conditonal filtering**

The possibilities provided by conditional filtering in Softr might not always be sufficient. So here are some workarounds I've discovered along the way:

- If you only want to show a particular number of records (for example to only show three examples in the list block on your homepage) set the **items per page** at this specific number AND remove the label by the **See more button** to remove that button.
- Need more advanced conditions? Airtable provides more options for this than Softr. Therefore, I'd recommend you to add an extra view to your table in Airtable and set up the filters (or filter groups) you need. Then select this view in the list block settings in Softr, so only the records in this view will appear on your page.

Some other extras that are good to know about...

- **Search bar**:  Do you have a long list of records in Airtable? Then it might help your visitors if you also add a search bar to your list page(s) ([instructions here](https://docs.softr.io/building-blocks/listings#search)). 

- **See more button and empty state**: At the bottom of the list block panel you can find some more settings:

    + If not all records are shown at once, you can use the [see more button](https://docs.softr.io/building-blocks/listings#see-more-button).
    + What message do you want to show to your visitors when there are no records to show to them, for example when they entered a search query? Learn more about this [here](https://docs.softr.io/building-blocks/listings#empty-state).


- **On click**

    + What action should be triggered when a visitor clicks on a record from your list? Link this to the list detail page, which we're going to set up tomorrow.


4. **Customise your list block**

Finally you can design all sections of your list block by clicking on the üé® icon. 

Repeat the above steps for all list blocks you have on your sitemap.

5. **Share your progress**

We're now ready to complete our resource directory tomorrow.

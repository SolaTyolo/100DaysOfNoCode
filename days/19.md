**What can I build in Notion?**

Notion is an all in one tool. That means, by definition, it can do quite a lot! Just look at their [template marketplace](https://www.notion.so/guides/start-with-a-template) to see how much! Below are some of the most common usecases for why you'd want to utilise Notion, which'll hopefully get your creative juices flowing.

**Key Notion concepts you should know**

‚ö° Blocks

Think of Notion as a bottomless bin of building blocks. Every page you create in Notion will be composed of many "blocks," in the same way a LEGO castle is composed of many LEGO bricks. Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLzaYMdbJMZW0gYyfNhL0sHheU5WR2YKE1&v=aA7si7AmPkY&feature=emb_title)  to see them in action. 

Here‚Äôs a list of Notion‚Äôs basic blocks...

+ Text
+ Headers
+ Images
+ Toggle Lists
+ To-do lists
+ Tables
+ Call-outs
+ Embeds (Video, Maps, articles)

‚ö° Pages

Pages are where you aggregate all the blocks listed above and are Notion‚Äôs equivalent to files.
